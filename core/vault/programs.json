The mission of the program is to expand and nourish the local, national, and international communities of forward-thinking theatre artists and to encourage the creation of groundbreaking original work. The Devised Performance program erases the lines of hierarchical artistic ownership in theatre and transforms the traditional norms and power structures central to the current regional theatre environment. Instead of working with pre-established texts, the program advocates creativity as dialogue rather than monologue; theatre-makers work together in an improvisational framework to create characters and performance texts wholly \u201cowned\u201d by creative ensembles. Rather than building new work around the spoken or written word, the program focuses intensively on the body and a physical approach to creating characters and theatrical ideas. The five-semester curriculum leverages a variety of disciplines and offers several channels of exploration in movement, voice, improvisation, and ensemble creation. The program is rooted in ensemble theatre practices and the embodied performance pedagogy of Jacques Lecoq, the French actor and movement coach who founded the internationally renowned theatre school \u00c9cole Internationale de th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq. Multiple Devised Performance faculty members have trained at the Lecoq school in Paris. Weekly seminars include masterclasses with theatre leaders, as well as poets, sculptors, videographers, and artists who work in a range of disciplines. Students are in studio class between 4 and 8 hours daily, pursuing courses that are designed to train the total theatre artist. Throughout each semester, students work collaboratively on projects, practicing theatre-making with their peers for faculty evaluation. The second year features several public performances.

In this accelerated dual undergraduate/graduate degree program, the acceleration is achieved by substituting 12 credits of graduate coursework for 12 credits of undergraduate coursework (specifically, elective credits), thus reducing the total number of credit hours required for the two degrees individually. Further, the accelerated dual degree program avoids the duplication of content required in both undergraduate and graduate-level courses in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). In addition to earning an MA more quickly, students in this program will save on tuition by taking 12 credits of MA courses as a senior at undergraduate tuition rates. Applied Behavior Analysis involves using well-established and empirically supported principles to assess and treat an array of behavioral concerns. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has been empirically shown to be effective in a wide variety of areas and has received the most recognition for developing effective and ethical behavioral services and supports for individuals with developmental disabilities and autism, including the treatment of severe behavior. The Applied Behavior Analysis Licensing Act was signed into law in the State of New Jersey in 2020 and will require a professional license for individuals to practice ABA, providing critical protections for consumers and a foundation for workforce development initiatives that will ensure access to quality ABA services provided by trained and ethical professionals. The requirements to become a Licensed Behavior Analyst (LBA) in the State of New Jersey will include 1) a graduate degree from an accredited university and 2) current certification as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst\u00ae (BCBA) or equivalent.

Thesis-track students will also be required to successfully complete a thesis defense. All students will require a minimum cumulative graduate GPA of 3.0 and minimum grades of B- in all graduate courses. Students in the ADD will thus only have to complete [120+30-12] 138 total credits for both degrees. Student Status: Students must maintain an overall (undergraduate + graduate) cumulative GPA of 3.0 in each semester they are enrolled in the ADD.  In addition, complete all requirements of the BS Physics (1902) degree before they begin the final year of the ADD. Students are expected to maintain full-time enrollment status (at least 9 graduate-level credits per semester) in the final two semesters of the ADD.  Students who enter the ADD but do not maintain satisfactory academic progress or who simply choose not to continue pursuing the MS degree will be allowed to formally \u201copt out\u201d back to the BS Physics (1902) program.  No more than 12 credits of graduate-level technical elective coursework may be applied to BS Physics (1902) requirements; however, students remain fully vested in their graduate coursework, which may be applied toward a future Rowan MS-MSE (G947) degree, subject to (re)admission and transcript (re)evaluation.  Such coursework may also be transferable to other institutions; however, transferability is a prerogative beyond Rowan\u2019s control. For students entering the ADD program on the standard BS Physics (1902) curriculum path, all BS degree requirements should be fulfilled by the 4th year of study, so the opt-out action will not result in a delayed BS degree conferral of more than one semester beyond that in which the \u201copt-out\u201d action was taken (due to Registrar\u2019s typical administrative timeline).

In addition to earning an M.A. more quickly, students in this program will save tuition by taking 12 credits of M.A. courses as a senior at undergraduate tuition rates. Applied Behavior Analysis involves using well-established and empirically supported principles to assess and treat an array of behavioral concerns. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has been empirically shown to be effective in a wide variety of areas and has received the most recognition for developing effective and ethical behavioral services and supports for individuals with developmental disabilities and autism, including the treatment of severe behavior (e.g., aggression, self-injury, property destruction). The Applied Behavior Analysis Licensing Act was signed into law in the State of New Jersey in 2020 and will require a professional license for individuals to practice ABA, providing critical protections for consumers and a foundation for workforce development initiatives that will ensure access to quality ABA services provided by trained and ethical professionals. The requirements to become a Licensed Behavior Analyst (LBA) in the State of New Jersey will include 1) a graduate degree from an accredited university and 2) current certification as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst\u00ae (BCBA) or equivalent. The Master of Arts in Applied Behavior Analysis fulfills the degree and coursework requirements for becoming a BCBA and LBA. Our program meets the behavior-analytic coursework requirements for those pursuing the BCBA/BCaBA Pathway 2 eligibility route. Applicants will need to meet additional requirements before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination. For more information on becoming a BCBA\u00ae, see the BACB Behavior Analyst Certification Board\u00ae (BACB\u00ae) standards at www.bacb.com."], "Program Requirements": ["Program Requirements"], "Undergraduate Program Requirements: 120 s.h.": ["Undergraduate Program Requirements: 120 s.h.As listed in the  Bachelor of Science in Psychological Science Please consult with your advisor to ensure you have taken all prerequisite courses for the Master\u2019s courses (12 s.h. of graduate courses taken as an undergraduate student)."], "Accelerated Program Requirements": ["Accelerated Program Requirements"], "Required BS Courses taken as an Undergraduate ADD student: 6 s.h.": ["Required BS Courses taken as an Undergraduate ADD student: 6 s.h.", "Course NameCredits:Term TakenGradeGen Ed", "PSY 02310 - Learning and Behavior (required course for Psychology Majors) Credits: 3", "PSY 02200 - Essential Skills for Behavior Technicians (elective course for Psychology Majors) Credits: 3", "In their senior year, students finish their undergraduate requirements while completing 12 hours of graduate coursework, including the following required courses:"], "Required MA Courses taken as an Undergraduate ADD student: 12 s.h.": ["Required MA Courses taken as an Undergraduate ADD student: 12 s.h.In their senior year, students finish their undergraduate requirements while completing 12 hours of graduate coursework, including the following required courses:", "Course NameCredits:Term TakenGradeGen Ed", "PSY 02500 - Basic Principles of Behavior Credits: 3", "PSY 02620 - Behavioral Assessment and Functional Analysis Credits: 3", "PSY 02510 - Research Methods in Behavior Analysis Credits: 3", "PSY 02610 - Applied Behavior Analysis Credits: 3"], "Required MA Courses taken as a Graduate student: 30 s.h.": ["Required MA Courses taken as a Graduate student: 30 s.h.The Remaining Courses for the Master\u2019s degree are as shown in Master of Arts in Applied Behavior Analysis"], "Total Required Credits for the Program: 150 s.h.": ["Total Required Credits for the Program: 150 s.h.Requirements for Admission: Applicants to the Accelerated Dual Degree program will apply for admission to the graduate program during the second semester of their junior year of the undergraduate program (February 15 deadline).

Additionally, the program is available for mental health professionals in the community seeking to enhance their professional development. The courses within the certificate program are intended to be advanced courses within the clinical mental health profession that will allow students to improve their practical knowledge and skills. Candidates seeking licensure are advised to read the regulations and requirements of the state\u2019s board where they intend to practice. The NJ Board of Licensed Professional Counselor regulations can be found at: http://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/pc/Pages/default.aspx. Students typically complete 12 semester hours of graduate credits in classes taught by the Clinical Mental Health Counseling Program within the Department of Psychology in order to bring their total credits to the state requirement of 60.

The 12 semester hours may be completed by taking a combination of courses within the Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study program. However, individual courses may have prerequisites associated with them.

Not a day goes by that we hear another story that talks about how machine learning has become part of our lives. The number of applications where machine learning systems make automated decisions in place of humans have grown exponentially. There is a significant demand in this area for qualified professionals, and these professionals have some of the highest starting salary of any profession. The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Applied Machine Learning in Engineering will be offered by the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and will consist of four (4) undergraduate-level courses as described below. A unique aspect of this CUGS is the practical hands-on experience option it provides: the CUGS in Applied Machine Learning in Engineering features four classes all of which featuring their own major project components. This CUGS also provides unique access for non-engineering students to Rowan Engineering\u2019s signature hallmark, the Senior Engineering Clinic, where students work in multidisciplinary teams on real-world unsolved problems. If taken twice across two consecutive semesters (2 credits each, for a total of 4 credits), Senior Engineering Clinic will provide a yearlong experience, which can then be used to count towards one of the electives in the CUGS. To qualify, students will need to take one of several specific sections of Senior Engineering Clinic that focuses on machine learning related projects. Hence, through this four-class sequence, the Applied Machine Learning in Engineering CUGS will provide breadth and depth in theoretical foundations of machine learning, as well as practical hands-on real-world project experience.

The U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DoE) Quadrennial Energy Review (QER) found that 1.5 million new jobs across the energy sector will need to be filled over the next several years, with many of these positions paying 50 to 80 percent more than the average annual salary. However, achieving the goals of \u201cSmart Grid\u201d is hampered by a growing shortage of qualified electric power and energy engineers. According to the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural resources, 77% of energy companies find it difficult to hire qualified employees. This Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Power Systems Engineering in intended to meet this unmet demand in graduating qualified engineers. The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Power Systems Engineering consists of four (4) undergraduate courses laying a strong technical foundation in electric power systems focused on the operation of emerging systems. Through this four-class sequence, students will be able to articulate the core concepts of conventional system analysis, different renewable system analysis, electricity market and different smart grid enabling techniques. Power Systems Engineering CUGS will provide students with breadth and depth in theoretical foundations of emerging power systems, as well as practical hands-on project experience. As a result of this CUGS, we expect our graduates to be particularly marketable, attracting many employers looking to hire highly qualified smart-grid ready power engineers.

Such a program in literatures from different regions of the world allows students to consider texts within a global rather than a national framework as well as to recognize the various influences and interactions between literary traditions. For example, how do authors from different cultures address similar questions pertaining to the human condition? How do different political and economic contexts affect how authors write in similar genres and literary periods? By requiring the study of literary masterpieces from various traditions, students will be better equipped to answer such questions and to understand how culture, and more specifically literature, despite being profoundly impacted by its national context, is in fact never national, that it has always been and will continue to be profoundly global and interconnected.

Students are expected to contribute to the research literature via professional presentations and publications during their time in the program.  In addition to research, students are involved in off-site practicum training at sites in the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware area, starting in their second year of the program. This practicum training includes the opportunity for interdisciplinary collaborations with Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Rowan School of Osteopathic Medicine, and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, among many other training sites. Students are supervised by doctoral-level psychologists at each site, and their progress is also monitored by program faculty.  The Rowan University Department of Clinical Psychology is committed to bringing together students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, emphasizing both individual differences and the interconnectedness between biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors.

The unique underpinning of this program is the intersection of two primary research foci: (1) a commitment to redressing systemic and persistent barriers to quality education and (2) a dedication to using rigorous empirical research with area schools, districts, colleges, and other educational partners to improve equity in educational outcomes. The Doctor of Philosophy offers its candidates opportunities to engage in research, college level teaching, and clinical experiences that respond to the regions and the nation\u2019s persistent challenges with educational access and equity in traditionally underserved communities. The Doctor of Philosophy at Rowan University requires the completion of 72 graduate semester hours (s.h.) made up of 21 s.h. of core courses, 15 s.h. of research courses, 15 s.h. of concentration specific courses, and 21 s.h. of dissertation. Concentrations The doctoral program offers five (5) concentrations:  Counselor Education: The Counselor Education concentration is designed specifically for those who wish to pursue careers as counselor educators at the university level, or as supervisors in schools or clinical settings. The program is committed to promoting the counseling profession and evidenced-based practices and initiatives through advanced curricular experiences that address systemic and persistent barriers for P-20 students. Higher & Postsecondary Education: The Higher & Postsecondary Education concentration of the Ph.D. in Education prepares students to conduct research on higher education organizations, students, and policy. Our graduates will pursue careers as academic faculty, researchers, senior college and university administrators, and policy analysts. Our curriculum provides a strong theoretical foundation in organizational theory, public policy, and issues of social justice in postsecondary institutions. Language & Literacy Education: The Language & Literacy Education Ph.D. concentration is designed to prepare individuals for roles in research, policy, and teaching in higher education. The courses examine influential theories and research that address the developmental, cognitive, motivational, multimodal, literary, linguistic, sociocultural and sociopolitical foundations of language and literacy. The program is strongly framed by a critical stance that emphasizes the transformative potential of language and literacy. Candidates for the literacy education doctorate conduct research examining major issues around the interaction of theory, research, and practice in their role in promoting access, equity and success across a range of educational contexts. Special Education: Students in the Special Education concentration examine critical issues in the field of special education and disability studies in education (DSE). The program encourages progressive thinking about traditional segregated special education practices, and changing educational structures to be fully inclusive for all students and families. At Rowan University, students and faculty engage in progressive research that promotes the development of inclusive schools and educational policy. Urban & Diverse Learning Environments: The Urban & Diverse Learning Environments concentration is designed to prepare future researchers, educators, community organizers, policymakers, and youth-focused change agents to understand and disrupt the contradictions that underpin educational and broader socioeconomic disparities. Our faculty actively engage in studying and challenging the social, political, and economic forces that bear on what is often labeled as \u201curban schooling,\u201d and shape the contradictions faced by youth, families, teachers, and educational leaders in these diverse learning environments that so often can be characterized by both oppression and resilience."], "Program Requirements": ["Program Requirements"], "Required Courses for All Concentrations: 21 s.h.": ["Required Courses for All Concentrations: 21 s.h.", "Course NameCredits:Term TakenGradeGen Ed", "CASE 90800 - Current Issues and Research in Access, Success, and Equity in Education Credits: 3", "CASE 90801 - Research Seminar in Access, Success, and Equity * Credits: 3", "CASE 90802 - Internship in the Academic Profession and Professoriate for Promoting Student Success Credits: 3", "CASE 90803 - Equity, Success, and Access Educational Research Credits: 3"], "Note:": ["Note:*Students will enroll in CASE 90801 twice for a total of 6 s.h."], "Required Research Courses for all Concentrations: 15 s.h.": ["Required Research Courses for all Concentrations: 15 s.h.", "Course NameCredits:Term TakenGradeGen Ed", "CASE 90718 - Research Literature Analysis and Writing in Education Credits: 3", "CASE 90811 - Multivariate Research Methods in Education Credits: 3", "CASE 90812 - Qualitative Research Methods in Education Credits: 3", "CASE 90814 - Advanced Qualitative Research Methods in Education Credits: 3"], "Concentration Courses: 15 s.h.": ["Concentration Courses: 15 s.h."], "Counselor Education Concentration Courses": ["Counselor Education Concentration CoursesGraduate Concentration in Counselor Education"], "Higher & Postsecondary Education Concentration Courses": ["Higher & Postsecondary Education Concentration CoursesGraduate Concentration in Higher & Postsecondary Education"], "Language & Literacy Concentration Courses": ["Language & Literacy Concentration CoursesGraduate Concentration in Literacy Education"], "Special Education Concentration Courses": ["Special Education Concentration CoursesGraduate Concentration in Special Education"], "Urban & Diverse Learning Environments": ["Urban & Diverse Learning EnvironmentsGraduate Concentration in Urban & Diverse Learning Environments", "Course NameCredits:Term TakenGradeGen Ed", "CASE 90710 - Power and Privilege: The Social Construction of Difference Credits: 3", "CASE 90512 - Examining Intersectionality in Critical Theories of Race, Class, Gender, Sexuality and Citizenship Credits: 3", "CASE 90513 - History of Urban Education and Communities Credits: 3", "CASE 90514 - Education Reform in the US: Theories of Change Credits: 3", "CASE 90530 - Curriculum Theories in Urban Education Credits: 3", "CASE 90532 - Working with Families and Communities Credits: 3", "CASE 90534 - Disability Studies Credits: 3", "CASE 90540 - Urban Education Policy and Reform Credits: 3", "CASE 90541 - Leadership for Social Justice and Educational Equity Credits: 3", "CASE 90542 - Engaging in Education and Community Credits: 3"], "Required Dissertation Research Course": ["Required Dissertation Research CoursePh.D. students must complete a minimum of 21 semester hours of Dissertation Research.", "Course NameCredits:Term TakenGradeGen Ed", "CASE 90890 - Dissertation Research Credits: 1 to 12", "CASE 98801 - Doctoral Dissertation Continuation (taken in special circumstances to keep full-time registration for dissertation students.)

Systems Engineering integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. Systems Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs. In addition, Systems Engineering incorporates concepts of \u201cbalanced design\u201d - achieving a product design that meets requirements but does not exceed them, and does so within the constraints of cost, schedule & performance, including life cycle costs; and \u201crisk assessment & management\u201d - understanding the technical and other risks that may be involved and managing the design to effectively mitigate the risks.

The role of the school nurse has substantially increased, making it necessary for our program to have a broad and deep interdisciplinary and knowledge-based approach. It allows the school nurse to become a productive member of an educational multidisciplinary team that links education with the psychosocial and medical needs of children. The National Coalition for School Health stated that baccalaureate programs for school nurses should emphasize public/community health nursing concepts and principles, including school nursing and community assessment with a practicum clinical experience. The Rowan University Post-Baccalaureate Certification in School Nursing (Non-Instructional) Program is designed to meet that research in concert with the New Jersey Administrative Code requirements for the Educational Services Certificate Endorsement for School Nurse (Non-Instructional), and with the National School Nurses Association. It recognizes the school nurse has a central management role in the implementation of health services. Our goal is to help candidates to become leaders in establishing links to the community, assessing needs and resources of the school community, and developing or modifying school health services. School nursing is a specialty practice that requires the school nurse to have a knowledge base that will allow for flexibility in the anticipation of change and to be proactive as a member of a consultative multidisciplinary team. This specialization requires knowledge of program planning, administrative delegation, and legal issues as they relate to caring for all students in an inclusive educational setting. Most nurses enter school nursing practice with education that is not specific to school nursing and with skills acquired in other nursing roles, often in acute care. As licensed health professionals, school nurses are expected to perform independent, high-quality care in a non-medical setting. This poses significant challenges not experienced by nurses working in settings with a medical/health focus. Schools can lack the procedural safeguards for nurses that can be found in health care settings, in terms of health-related policies and procedures. In addition, the role of the school nurse is poorly understood by stakeholders (parents, school staff, and administrators), as well as among other nurses. Nevertheless, school nurses serve in pivotal roles that bridge health care and education (National Association of School Nurses, 2016). \u201cKeeping children healthy, safe, in school, and ready to learn should be a top priority for both healthcare and educational systems. With approximately 55.9 million candidates in public and private elementary and secondary schools, educational institutions are excellent locations to promote health in children, and the school nurse is uniquely positioned to meet candidate health needs\u201d (NASN, 2016). However, the reality is that the focus of schools is on education, not health, and the connection between the two is, unfortunately, underrecognized in the K-12 setting. As school nurses provide care to a diverse student body with a variety of acute, chronic, and complex health care needs, it is imperative that they have opportunities to practice higher-level nursing skills and reflect on their practice. Successful transition to practice depends on a balance of nursing knowledge and skills, and collaboration between school nurse candidates, cooperating school nurse mentors, and university faculty. Program Features Dedicated school nurses serve an essential function in the school community by protecting and promoting students\u2019 health. The Post-Baccalaureate Certification in School Nursing (Non-Instructional) program at Rowan University, through the College of Education, prepares New Jersey licensed registered nurses who hold a bachelor\u2019s degree to assume a multifaceted role that supports the physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being of students in public schools in preschool through grade 12. This flexible hybrid program builds upon a nurse\u2019s healthcare experiences, which will best qualify them for the interdisciplinary aspects of school health. Students will learn the functions of the school nurse and how he/she is a vital part of the educational team. Upon completion of the program, students are eligible for NJDOE School Nursing (Non-Instructional) Certification. This certification does NOT authorize the teaching in areas related to health.
