            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Queer Theory The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Queer Theory provides a sequence of courses that will expose students to queer theoretical approaches and teach them to apply these approaches across multiple disciplines. Students can choose courses from the bank that most appeal to their interests, developing deeper understandings of gender, sex, and sexuality, and how they play out in the world today. This CUGS is designed to complement and enhance a student’s major program, as well as to prepare students for graduate studies and professional careers."
