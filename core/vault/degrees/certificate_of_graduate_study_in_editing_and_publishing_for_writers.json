            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Editing & Publishing for Writers Due to recent changes in the publishing industry (corporate mergers, ever-advancing publishing technologies, radical alterations in traditional book distribution and bookselling) writers are now compelled to be excellent editors and marketers of their own work. Utilizing a curriculum that combines advanced editing and revision of works of the student’s own choice (nonfiction book, YA novel, poetry, articles and essays), along with the hands-on opportunities in classes, students will acquire a necessary understanding of contemporary editing and publishing procedures in a variety of print and digital environments, including periodicals, and digital and book publishing, as well as the discipline and organizational strategies necessary to prepare and submit a variety of types of work for publication."
