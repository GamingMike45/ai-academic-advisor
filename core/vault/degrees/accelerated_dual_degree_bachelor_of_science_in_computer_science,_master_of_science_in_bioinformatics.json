            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Master of Science in Bioinformatics The Accelerated Dual Degree Bachelor of Science/Master of Science (BS/MS) in Bioinformatics Program allows competent and highly motivated undergraduate students to complete the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Master of Science in Bioinformatics in five years as opposed to the traditional period of six years if both degrees were completed separately. Only upper-level undergraduate Computer Science majors who have been admitted into the Bachelor of Science Computer Science Degree Program will be allowed to apply for the Accelerated Dual Degree Bachelor of Science/Master of Science in Bioinformatics Program. Once admitted, a student will enroll as a full-time undergraduate in both undergraduate Computer Science and graduate Bioinformatics courses in their first year of the Program to complete requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Degree and then enroll as a full-time student in graduate Bioinformatics courses in their second year of the Program to complete requirements for the Master of Science in Bioinformatics Degree. The Master of Science in Bioinformatics Degree is a 30 credits program. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science/Masters of Bioinformatics Dual Degree is structured so that students first complete requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Degree Program, but can replace 12 credits of undergraduate Computer Science electives with 12 credits of graduate coursework that are required for the Master of Science in Bioinformatics Degree Program in their senior year (fourth year). In their fifth year, students will take the additional 18 graduate credits required for the Master of Science in Bioinformatics Degree."
