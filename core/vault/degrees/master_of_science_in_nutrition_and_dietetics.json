This CPD Program is an Accreditation Council for Education for Nutrition & Dietetics [ACEND] approved program of study that prepares graduates to be eligible to take the national exam towards earning the Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist (RDN) credential. This CDP Program has a unique admission process that takes place in the second semester of the second year of undergraduate coursework towards earning the Nutrition B.S. degree. Graduates of the program provide nutrition education and consultation, evaluate patients/clients and provide dietary assessments and recommendations in hospital, education and community settings. Program students take their graduate level dietetic courses online via Canvas as a cohort. Supervised practice hours are scheduled at several affiliated learning facilities. Student placements at affiliated facilities are based on availability of appropriate facility preceptors. Supervised practice consists of onsite learning at healthcare, community health, schools and food service organizations. Each scheduled rotation has learning goals and objectives as well as tools to assess learning experiences toward required industry competencies. Graduate students are given the opportunity to participate in learning activities in a specialty area of practice location based on availability and receipt of necessary approvals."
