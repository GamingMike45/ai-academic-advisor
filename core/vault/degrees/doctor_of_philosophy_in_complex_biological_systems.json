            "Doctor of Philosophy in Complex Biological Systems Modern societal challenges in biological sciences are complex and transcend scale; they also rapidly evolve. Solutions to complex biological problems require multi level understanding, from molecular and atomic levels to populations and ecosystems, technologies that operate across these scales, and teams that cover all scales. The Complex Biological Systems Ph.D. program is use-oriented, problem-focused, and emphasizes the scales of societal problems (from molecules to ecological systems) and the connections between these scales. This program brings together interdisciplinary faculty mentors with overlapping big-picture goals and complementary skill sets, providing students with diverse cutting-edge dissertation research experiences. Students possessing a bachelor’s degree will be required to complete a minimum of 72 semester hours of graduate-level coursework. Students possessing a master’s degree in a related field will be required to complete a minimum of 42 semester hours of graduate-level coursework beyond their master’s degree. A minimum of 30 semester hours are required from research/dissertation courses."
