            "Bachelor of Arts in Dance The Bachelor of Arts in Dance is a performance degree that integrates the study of dance within a liberal arts curriculum. Dance majors move, think, and create. The BA in Dance provides multiple opportunities for students to develop technical and creative skills and express themselves as diverse and informed artists. Our theoretical and practical approaches to the study of dance stimulate physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual growth while preparing students for professional careers (in dance). Dance majors at Rowan University are immersed in a cross-disciplinary program that requires creating and collaborating with dancers, designers, artists, musicians, and the University community at large, embracing all aspects of the Liberal Arts experience."
