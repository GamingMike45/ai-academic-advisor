        "Minor in Creative Writing": [
            "Minor in Creative Writing The Writing Arts Department at Rowan University offers a program of study in creative writing leading to a minor. To fulfill the requirements for the minor, students must complete 18 hours of course work selected from a variety of courses in the writing of poetry, fiction, children’s stories, plays, television and film scenarios. The minor is open to Writing Arts majors and students who are not Writing Arts majors. Writing Arts majors who complete the 12 credit creative writing concentration within the major may take an additional 6 credits to receive the minor. No required courses counting toward the Writing Arts major can be double counted for the Creative Writing Minor. Students do not have to be in the minor to take creative writing courses. Once enrolled in the Creative Writing Minor, students can look forward to these goals and achievements: The ability to understand and apply creative writing craft elements in a variety of genres The ability to read and critique texts through the strategies of close reading A deeper understanding of the relationship between the writer, the audience, and the work The opportunity to experiment creatively with various genres as the student develops a voice and a style"
