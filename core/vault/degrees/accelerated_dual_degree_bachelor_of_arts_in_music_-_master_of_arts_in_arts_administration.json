            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Arts in Music - Master of Arts in Arts Administration Overview The Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Arts in Music/Master of Arts in Arts Administration program is a program that combines a liberal arts degree with a focus in music with a masters program that prepares students for positions in arts organizations. Students complete both degrees in five years by taking graduate courses during the senior year of the Bachelor of Arts. This is a hybrid program where the Bachelor of Arts is taken in-person while Master of Arts courses are delivered online. By completing both degrees, students receive both a broad background in music studies along with practical and marketable business and administrative skills that prepare them for varied careers in the arts."
