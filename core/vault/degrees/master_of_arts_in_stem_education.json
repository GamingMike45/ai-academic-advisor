            "Master of Arts in STEM Education The need for teachers in high-need disciplines continues to grow. This program addresses these needs by selecting exceptionally able college seniors and career changers with science, technology, engineering, or mathematics backgrounds from across the country and supporting them to develop successful careers as highly skilled math, science, and technology teachers. The Master of Arts in STEM Education (M.A. STEM) offers the unique opportunity for students who have undergraduate degrees in the mathematics, engineering, or the sciences to pursue an initial New Jersey teaching certificate in mathematics and/or one of the sciences and a master’s degree simultaneously. This program is carefully designed such that all coursework has a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) focus that provides the ideal pedagogical preparation for prospective Mathematics or Science teachers in the P-12 setting. This 13-month program includes an early field experience, face-to-face, online, and hybrid courses, and a year-long teacher residency. The culminating experience is a seminar in which students transition from teacher candidate to teacher by planning for leading their own classrooms.
