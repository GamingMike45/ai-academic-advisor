            "Bachelor of Arts in Computing & Informatics This program is designed for students who are interested in pursuing careers in information technology which requires a solid understanding of the principles of computing - but not the underpinnings of computer science theory and mathematics. Students will acquire the requisite computer programming skills across programming languages and development platforms to develop a career as a computing professional, work as part of a project team, be able to analyze a problem and effectively document and communicate all aspects of the solution, and understand ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities in computing. The Bachelor of Arts in Computing & Informatics contains several optional concentrations and a wide range of advanced electives. This degree prepares graduates for jobs in business and industry and can easily be combined with other degrees for students seeking a double major. Students, in consultation with faculty advisors, can construct flexible and comprehensive programs. The program prepares students to find careers in business, industry, government, and education, where they work as computer programmers, infrastructure administrators, deployment technicians, QA/testing engineers, support technicians, technical application trainers, and technical documentation specialists. Advanced placement credit is accepted for incoming freshmen students."
