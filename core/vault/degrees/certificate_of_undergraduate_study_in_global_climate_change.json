            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Global Climate Change The Earth’s climate is dynamic, complex, and changing at an alarming pace. The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Global Climate Change is an introduction to climate science and the fundamentals of the climate system. In this series of courses, students learn how climate change is affecting the world today, what the science says about future climate impacts, and the geological context for climate change both past and future. The CUGS in Global Climate Change is open to any matriculated or non-matriculated student with an interest in the science of Global Climate Change from any degree program."
