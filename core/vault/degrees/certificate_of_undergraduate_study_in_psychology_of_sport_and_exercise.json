            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Psychology of Sport & Exercise The Psychology of Sport & Exercise CUGS will provide students with a sequence of courses to enhance knowledge in the field of psychology and performance in the sport and exercise environment. Achieving this certificate will enhance awareness of general information regarding sports psychology, performance and exercise by focusing on theories, models, and processes. This CUGS will be of value to students interested in working in health profession fields in positions such as a strength and conditioning coach, athletic trainer, occupational and physical therapist, educator, health behavior coach, etc. Having an understanding of sport and exercise psychology when working with potential clients, patients, students and athletes are critical to providing care utilizing a whole-body approach. Although students will not be receiving a degree in Sports Psychology, this CUGS can prepare those that are interested in obtaining a graduate degree in psychology, a doctoral degree in Sports Psychology and even those with future professional goals of becoming a certified consultant for the Association of Applied Sport Psychology after receiving their terminal degree with theoretical framework of this field. Since Rowan University does not have a minor in sport psychology, this CUGS will provide the first experience in this field for students to obtain a certificate of specialization."
