            "Master of Science in Computer Science The Master of Science in Computer Science will provide individuals with the opportunity to acquire an excellent graduate level education in Computer Science that prepares them to work in a variety of computer related fields, including education, industry, research, business, and government. The M.S. in Computer Science is designed for individuals with a B.S. in Computer Science who are looking to expand their knowledge and opportunities. Students with a bachelor’s degree in another discipline may also apply for the M.S. in Computer Science after meeting certain eligibility criteria. This degree can be completed as a full-time or part-time student. Most classes are offered in the evening to enable students to complete their degree while working. Rowan University undergraduates majoring in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program may apply to the Accelerated Dual Degree (ADD) program which allows them to earn both the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in five years instead of six. The M.S. in Computer Science is a 31 credit-hour program with an optional thesis track. Ten distinct courses must be taken to fulfill the Master’s Degree. Any course taken that belongs in multiple categories cannot double count. Up to two courses may be taken from other, appropriate graduate programs subject to advisor approval, provided all requirements for this M.S. degree are fulfilled. Tracks The program includes two tracks - a thesis track and a non-thesis track. Non-Thesis Track: Students choosing the non-thesis track take 31 credits of traditional (non-thesis) courses. Thesis Track: Students choosing the thesis track will also take 31 credits, but they will substitute between 6 to 9 credits of thesis courses for traditional (non-thesis) courses."
