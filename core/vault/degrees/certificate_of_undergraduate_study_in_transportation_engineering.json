            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Transportation Engineering The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Transportation Engineering will allow students to increase the depth and breadth of knowledge in transportation engineering fundamentals during their undergraduate studies. This will allow students to graduate from Rowan University better prepared for a career specifically in Transportation Engineering than they would with just the BS degree, and provide them with an additional credential beyond the BS, yet prior to earning a MS degree."
