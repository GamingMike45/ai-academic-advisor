            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Automotive Engineering This CUGS will offer students the chance to increase their knowledge beyond the standard 120 credit Mechanical Engineering curriculum in the rapidly growing fields of automotive engine design, alternative vehicle powertrains, vehicle dynamics, and vehicle manufacturing. The program is particularly relevant with recent advancements in gasoline, diesel, hybrid electric, and battery electric powertrains, as well as in active suspensions, active vehicle dynamics/safety systems, and autonomous vehicles. This CUGS will be attractive to students who already have fundamental knowledge in Mechanical Engineering."
