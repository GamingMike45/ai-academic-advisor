            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Cannabinoid Chemistry The Certificate of Graduate Study (CUGS) in Cannabinoid Chemistry will prepare its students in the fundamental and underlying science necessary for the analysis of marijuana, cannabinoids, and related materials. Due to the increased nationwide trends toward legalization and prescription of medical marijuana, development of cannabis related therapies, and legalization of recreational marijuana (including in the State of NJ), there is a pressing need for scientists trained in the analysis of cannabinoid containing materials. This training would be useful to careers in health professions, food science, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology."
