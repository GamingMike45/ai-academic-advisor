            "Minor in Data Science The minor in Data Science is designed to give students a strong foundation in programming, data structures, statistics, and data mining. The program will allow students to be able to use data science skills in any area of specialization, and it prepares them to work as Big Data analysts or to take advantage of large amounts of data in their own disciplines. In addition, the program will allow students to be able to understand issues related to ethics and privacy concerns posed by data mining. The Data Science minor consists of 1 required course in each of 6 knowledge areas and 2 electives:"
