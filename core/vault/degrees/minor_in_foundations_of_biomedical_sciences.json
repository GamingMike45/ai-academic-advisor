            "Minor in Foundations of Biomedical Sciences This minor provides general required prerequisites and tracks with electives specific to health profession schools.  It is intended for non-STEM majors who will not acquire these courses through their own major but may be a useful tool for all students to understand the common prerequisites of each health professional school they plan to continue to.  Examples of health profession schools include but are not limited to medical, dental, podiatry, physical therapy, physician assistant, accelerated  - nursing, and optometry programs.  We strongly suggest working with an advisor from the Office of Pre-Health Programs in addition to your academic advisor to plan your minor coursework in a way that allows timely application to professional school, including preparation of admission testing.  The Pre-Health advisor can also help you set experiential learning goals outside of academics in order to develop a competitive application. Note : For most health professional schools, required coursework will go beyond the 29 semester hours of this minor and thus additional courses suggested have been provided below. Restrictions : majors whose required coursework overlaps with the majority of this minor are not able to enroll.  These majors are Biochemistry, Bioengineering, Bioinformatics, Biological Sciences (BS or BA), Biophysics, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Exercise Science, Molecular & Cellular Biology, Neuroscience, Nutrition with a Dietician Concentration, Physics, and Translational Biomedical Sciences. Students in these majors can consult with the Office of Pre-Health Programs to select an appropriate minor."
