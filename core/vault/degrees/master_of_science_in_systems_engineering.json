            "Master of Science in Systems Engineering The Electrical & Computer Engineering program provides students an opportunity to expand their skill sets in advanced and emerging topics of systems engineering interest through the Master of Science in Systems Engineering degree program. This interdisciplinary career-oriented program consists of 12 credits of required courses, 12 credits of courses from one of the several COGS, and 6 additional credits of electives. The program offers opportunities for stacked credentials through the existing certificates of graduate studies (COGS). In their program of study for M.S. in Systems Engineering, students choose any of the approved COGS in Combat Systems Engineering (a unique Rowan ECE offering that is not available anywhere else in the country), Machine Learning, Cybersecurity Engineering, Power Systems Engineering, Wind Energy Systems, Project Management, Engineering Analytics & Quality Control, Software Engineering, cybersecurity Principles, or others (the approved list appears below). Additional electives may be chosen from any of the approved COGS other than the one main COGS chosen, as well as other engineering and business courses, providing students with a unique flexibility and diversity of courses, allowing the students to custom design their MS in Systems Engineering to best fit their careers’ specific needs. The M.S. in Systems Engineering program can be completed in a thesis or professional (course-only/non-thesis) track. In the thesis track, 6 credits from 2 electives are replaced with the thesis work. With an appropriate selection of courses, BS in Electrical & Computer Engineering and MS in Systems Engineering (professional track) can be completed in a 4+1 BS/MS format."
