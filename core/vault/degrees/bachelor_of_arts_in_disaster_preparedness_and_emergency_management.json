            "Bachelor of Arts in Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Management The Bachelor of Arts in Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Management is an interdisciplinary academic program, designed to provide rigorous academic preparation for students interested in seeking advanced emergency management professional, homeland security education and training or a career in international, national, state, and local disaster preparedness, emergency management, and safety areas with an emphasis on urban environments. The Program in Disaster Science & Emergency Management prepares graduates, within an risk-based management approach, to assume roles as leaders where they can enhance the safety, security, risk, and resilience of the community, region, and nation by providing relevant education, professional training, research opportunities, and other assistance to those who are, or aspire to become, responsible for preventing, mitigating, responding to, or recovering from, a natural, human-induced, or technological disaster-in service to humanity. We offer a “transformative education” that reflects our commitment to engaging students to be effective change agents who are “best-practices-informed” to function under the most arduous circumstances. As an applied science, Disaster Science employs scientific methods to produce convergence research and knowledge to attain practical goals within a value-engineering framework by: Analyzing hazard risk and their influence on the natural and build environmental, social, cultural, political, and economic dimensions of human settlement. Developing interventions that advance pre-disaster preparedness, respond to disaster emergencies, aid in post-disaster reconstruction and recovery, and facilitate mitigation within the public, private, and nonprofit sectors based on societal needs and cost-effective risk-based approaches. Informing decision-making, which includes policies, plans, and other regulations, using a risk-based approach. Promoting communication and collaboration Modeling and using statistical methods to quantify disaster risk and exposure (see: https://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/dsm/; https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective- students/graduate/taught-degrees/risk-disaster- science-msc) The current focus areas include biomedical preparedness (in conjunction with the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University), public administration and civic leadership, and civil safety/justice administration, all of which lead to establishing core competencies in emergency preparedness. In addition to providing students with a broad understanding of safety and security issues, the Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Management degree program focuses on several vital components of the emergency management field: Critical Infrastructure Protection Disaster Preparedness and Response Intelligence Sharing and Analysis Graduates will be prepared to work in a variety of settings and agencies that focus on emergency rescue and response, homeland security, hospitals, municipal emergency management, county emergency management, safety management, intelligence analysis, private security, airports, state and local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, customs investigators, special agents, military service and border security and patrol. The upper-level courses for this major are offered on the Camden Campus of Rowan University."

                "Approved Internship Class/Field Experience Class: 3 s.h. * All students are required to register for and complete an approved Internship Class/approved Field Experience Class to graduate. Students seeking to enroll in an internship/field experience must secure the approval of the program director prior to enrollment. Upon prior approval, only dual majors can earn course graduation credit for an internship taken outside of the Disaster Science & Emergency Management offerings.  Dual majors must consult with the Emergency Management Program Director or Professor of Internship for internship/field experience approval to enroll in a non-DPEM 43495 Internship Class. Without prior approval, students will not be allowed to earn the credits needed to fulfill the internship graduation requirements. The internship class for a minimum of 3 s.h. cannot be waived.  Also, Rowan Student Patrol (within the Rowan University Police Department) cannot be used to fulfill the internship requirement in Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Management. All prerequisites must be completed before enrolling in DPEM 43495. Please contact your advisor if you have any questions. * 3 s.h. are required, 6 s.h. are recommended"
