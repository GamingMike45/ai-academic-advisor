            "Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical Engineering The Doctor of Philosophy degree in Biomedical Engineering emphasizes intensive, novel research within a flexible graduate curriculum with a core focused on technical fundamentals. With faculty-mentored biomedical research, students are trained to apply engineering approaches to solve novel, contemporary biomedical problems in areas such as biomaterials engineering, tissue engineering, biomechanics, biomedical robotics, drug delivery, biomolecule detection, and other emerging fields. Students in the biomedical engineering doctoral program benefit from our close association with physicians at Virtua Health System, Rowan-Virtua University School of Osteopathic Medicine, and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, which stimulates translation into the clinic. A growing business school on the main campus and access to the Office of Technology Commercialization and the Rowan Innovation Fund allows and fosters the progression of applied translational biomedical research into commercial products and processes."

A minimum of 30 hours must come from core/elective coursework with a minimum of 12 of these coursework hours coming from Biomedical Engineering Core Courses. Credits beyond 30 may come from additional core/elective coursework or Ph.D. Dissertation Research hours (up to 42). Foundation Courses The following undergraduate courses are required. Prior to applying: Chemistry I, Physics I, Calculus I, and Calculus II Prior to starting the program: Calculus III, Differential Equations* and Linear Algebra* *Differential Equations and Linear Algebra may be taken during the first semester of residence (these courses are in addition to 30 hours of graduate coursework). For applicants with undergraduate majors that are not Biomedical Engineering or a closely related field, Biomedical Engineering Core undergraduate courses may be required for completion of the degree (these courses are in addition to 30 hours of graduate coursework). Graduation/Exit/Thesis Requirements Successful completion of Preliminary Exam, Qualifying Exam & Dissertation Defense Scholarship including: Peer reviewed journal papers, Conference presentations. BME Seminar attendance each semester (BME 11600, 0 credits) Safety and responsible conduct of research training Completion of two mentored TA assignments Students without comparable previous undergraduate coursework may be required to take undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Foundation courses in addition to their graduate coursework requirements. Minimum Required Grades and Cumulative GPA The Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical Engineering is a Category 2 program.
