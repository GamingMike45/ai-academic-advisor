            "Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmaceutical Chemistry Rowan’s Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Chemistry is a terminal degree program that will provide students with the skills necessary to succeed in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. This program is highly interdisciplinary and will provide diverse research experiences for the students in: a) preparation of drugs (organic synthesis); b) chemical characterization (analytical chemistry); c) understanding the role of molecular modifications in determining structure-activity relationships (medicinal/biochemistry); d) in vitro and in vivo evaluation of biological targets (pharmacology); and e) understanding the mechanism of action and metabolism of the drug within the body (pharmacodynamics/kinetics). There will be an emphasis on independent supervised research that will culminate in significant new contributions to the field in the form of publications, presentations, or generation of new intellectual property."
