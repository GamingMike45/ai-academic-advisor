            "Graduate Endorsement in Teacher of Students with Disabilities This program is designed for individuals who possess a standard instructional certificate, or possess/are eligible for CEAS and wish to obtain Teacher of Students with Disabilities certification in New Jersey. Students must teach full-time in a P-12 class setting to complete field-related assignments throughout this program. The program aims to provide advanced studies focusing on the educational, psychological, and sociological needs of children and youth with disabilities. Each course in the program builds on the earlier knowledge and skills gained in the candidate’s initial certification programs. The coursework and related field experiences are designed to foster an understanding of students with a range of strengths and learning needs, combined with pedagogical skills to support these needs and provide appropriate multi-tiered inclusive practices as well as strengths-based, tailored curriculum accommodations and modifications when necessary. Upon completing the program, candidates will be recommended for certification. Candidates who want to pursue a Master’s degree (MA in Special Education and Inclusive Practices) must apply through Rowan Global Student Services. Candidates will have the option of applying completed Graduate TOSD coursework towards the GE track or they may select from alternative track options to gain advanced content knowledge in other areas. Students who have completed the Certificate of Graduate Study in Special Education and want to pursue the certification of Teacher of Students with Disabilities need to reapply for this endorsement program."
