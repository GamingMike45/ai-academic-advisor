            "Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training Studies The Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training Studies (BSATS) is designed for a dual purpose: 1) to enable students to successfully complete the Master of Science in Athletic Training; 2) allow students to apply to another allied healthcare professional school (i.e., PT, OT, etc.) or athletic training program within or outside the state should they either choose not to, or cannot complete the MSAT requirements. Hence, students who choose not to finish or cannot complete the MSAT requirement will be able to graduate within their original graduation timeline. This degree will also be awarded en route to completing the MSAT for students successfully completing all academic requirements. The BSATS will not be available to incoming freshmen . Freshman students will apply to the Pre-Athletic Training Curriculum when applying to Rowan University. The first three years of the BS in Athletic Training Studies will match up with the Pre-Athletic Training Curriculum. In the spring of the 3rd year, eligible students can apply to the Athletic Training Program. Those who are accepted will begin taking graduate-level courses in the summer after their junior year. Those not accepted to the Athletic Training Program will need to either change their major to Exercise Science or reapply to the Athletic Training Program one year later during the scheduled application cycle. The BSATS will only be available to those students who are unable to continue in the Athletic Training Program or choose not to continue in the Athletic Training program once they have been accepted. Please see the Master of Science in Athletic Training course sequence for more information. Students must earn a grade of at least a C in each course under Non-program and Program requirements to be eligible to apply to the Master of Science in Athletic Training. Students must also maintain a 3.0 overall and major GPA to be eligible to apply to the MSAT. Students not accepted into the MSAT are required to maintain a 2.0 overall GPA to graduate with a BS in Athletic Training Studies."
