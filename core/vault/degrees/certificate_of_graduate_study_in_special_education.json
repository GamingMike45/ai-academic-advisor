            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Special Education The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Special Education is designed for general education teachers who wish to increase their knowledge of special education, as well as special education teachers who wish to pursue further coursework at the graduate level. The goal of this certificate is to provide teachers with an overview of the salient issues in special education, as well as opportunities to focus on the essential aspects of evidence-based practices. This COGS is for advanced content knowledge only and does not lead to any certification or endorsement. This Certificate of Graduate Study is offered in an online format and can be used to satisfy the Content Certificate of Graduate Study requirement in the Master of Education in Teacher Leadership program. Teachers who successfully complete the Certificate of Graduate Study coursework can also opt to continue pursuit of the Teacher of Students with Disabilities Graduate Endorsement Program (see a department representative for additional details)."
