            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Teaching English as a Second Language Education This program enables students to gain knowledge and skills in teaching English as a Second Language (ESL). ESL education is currently a critical teaching shortage area both in NJ and across the U.S. The program is open to students in current College of Education teacher education programs who want to add an ESL certification; students with a teaching certification from another institution who want to gain expertise in ESL; and students from other majors who are not seeking P-12 certification, but who plan to teach English as a Foreign Language (EFL) abroad or ESL in US-based community programs (e.g., for adults, in the workplace, etc.). Upon successful completion of the CUGS, students who already have another appropriate teaching license or who are concurrently seeking another initial teaching license (eg., P-3; K-5; Mathematics; Social Studies; Health and PE; Music; Art; Science, etc.) will be eligible to apply for the NJ ESL P-12 certification."
