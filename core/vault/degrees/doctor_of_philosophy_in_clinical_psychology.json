                "Doctor of Philosophy in Clinical Psychology The Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology adheres to a scientist-practitioner model of training, emphasizing the development of skills consistent with a research career or a career that includes the integration of clinical practice and research. In addition to the broad training goals, the program also offers experience in integrated healthcare and health psychology, as reflected in at least three courses in this area, applied practicum experiences in healthcare settings, and conducting original scientific research with a health focus. The program is not intended for those who are only interested in pursuing clinical practice. Students in the program are paired with a research mentor upon entering and maintain a research focus consistent with their mentor during their time in the program. Students are also expected to continue to develop their ability to function with greater autonomy throughout their time in the program, ultimately culminating in their ability to conduct research independently upon graduation. Students are expected to contribute to the research literature via professional presentations and publications during their time in the program. In addition to research, students are involved in off-site practicum training at sites in the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware area, starting in their second year of the program. This practicum training includes the opportunity for interdisciplinary collaborations with Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Rowan School of Osteopathic Medicine, and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, among many other training sites. Students are supervised by doctoral-level psychologists at each site, and their progress is also monitored by program faculty. The Rowan University Department of Clinical Psychology is committed to bringing together students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, emphasizing both individual differences and the interconnectedness between biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. Issues related to diversity are integrated into all training activities, and the promotion of an inclusive and diverse training community and workforce constitutes guiding values of the program and its faculty. The curriculum content is consistent with the American Psychological Association&#39;s (APA) Accreditation Standards. Additionally, these standards are consistent with requirements for licensure as a Psychologist in NJ as well as nationwide. The Rowan University Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program is APA-accredited. Questions related to the program’s accredited status can be directed to the Commission on Accreditation.
