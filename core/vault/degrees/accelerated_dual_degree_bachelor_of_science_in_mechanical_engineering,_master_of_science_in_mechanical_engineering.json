            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering The Accelerated BS/MS Dual Degree Program in Mechanical Engineering permits students to complete the 120-credit BS-ME and the 30-credit MS-ME degree (Non-Thesis Option) programs in under five years, while keeping coursework at a manageable full-time load and with a modest tuition and fee discount. Students may take up to 12 credits of graduate-level coursework while enrolled as undergraduate students in this program. Coursework attempted at the graduate level does not double-count as coursework attempted at the undergraduate level. Accordingly, students interested in this program should ensure sufficient space in their respective undergraduate schedules to maximize its advantages; the related Senior Privilege program may also be of interest as an alternative option for students seeking access to graduate-level education while still at the undergraduate level. Note that the Accelerated BS/MS Dual Degree Program and Senior Privilege program cannot be combined or used simultaneously. Enrollment Requirements Undergraduate students typically enroll in this Accelerated Dual Degree (ADD) program after completing ~79 credits of their respective BS-ME coursework requirements, including 70 credits of STEM coursework. Successful applicants will have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 out of 4.0 and grades of C+ or better in the foundation courses required to apply to the Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Further details regarding the structure of and enrollment in the ADD program can be found at the Registrar’s website and/or discussed with the Program Advisor. Accelerated Program Features Students enrolled in this program may apply up to 12 credits of Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering  Required or Required Specialized Program coursework successfully completed while an undergraduate towards their respective MS-ME degree requirements."
