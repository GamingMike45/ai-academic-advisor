        "Overview": [
            "Overview The Department of Physics & Astronomy and the Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine (RowanSOM) offer a Bachelor of Science in Biophysics and a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, respectively. This accelerated program allows high-achieving Biophysics majors to obtain the Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine in a seven-year period, rather than the traditional period of eight years if both degrees were completed separately. The program is a 3 + 4 arrangement where students begin Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine courses in their 4th year at Rowan University."

        "Eligibility and Admissions:": [
            "Eligibility and Admissions: High school seniors who qualify for admission to Rowan University are eligible for admission to the 3+4 program. There are no restrictions on State of residency, but admission is limited to citizens or permanent residents of the United States. The high school grade point average and rank-in-class, along with letters of recommendation from high school teachers, will be of primary importance in evaluating an applicant’s credentials. Applicants are required to submit scores of the College Board Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) Verbal and Mathematical components or the American College Testing (ACT). Applicants are expected to demonstrate knowledge of, and activity resonant with, the mission of RowanSOM. After preliminary evaluation of applications by the Rowan University Admissions Office, the Joint Admissions Committee, composed of representatives from the premedical faculty of Rowan University and the Admissions Committee of RowanSOM, will decide which applicants to invite for interview at Rowan University and RowanSOM. Interviews at RowanSOM will be conducted by a member of the RowanSOM Admissions Committee. Applicants not invited for an interview, or not selected for admission to the 3+4 program, shall be notified of decisions as early as possible and shall be considered for regular admission to Rowan University. First year students at Rowan University who are not accepted into the program may continue their undergraduate course of study and would be eligible to apply for the 4+4 program in their Sophomore year at Rowan University. Student Status: Students will be eligible admission to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine portion of the program after the Rowan University Coordinator of Premedical Programs has certified that the candidate has met all basic prerequisite requirements, after completion of the MCAT, and after a successful interview with the RowanSOM Admissions Committee. Students apply for an admissions decision to RowanSOM no later than October I of the 3'” year, but preferably by August 15 before their 3rd year. Acceptance of such candidates is based on meeting or surpassing the requirements listed above. Tuition for the first three (3) years of study at Rowan University, including summer courses, if any, will be the same tuition as charged to undergraduate Rowan University students. Tuition during the four (4) years of study at RowanSOM will be the same as the tuition charged to students enrolled in the regular curriculum at RowanSOM. Students who satisfactorily complete the appropriate courses in the first year at RowanSOM, in addition to all other undergraduate degree requirements, will receive a Bachelor of Science in Biophysics degree. If, after the first semester of the medical first year, the student fails to meet the required RowanSOM standards of performance and competency, representatives from Rowan University and RowanSOM will meet with the student. If, after meeting with the student, RowanSOM concludes that the student should not continue in the medical school, the student shall be dismissed from the Bachelor of Science/Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program. In consultation with the Biophysics coordinator, the Bachelor of Science in Biophysics degree may be completed.",
