                "Bachelor of Arts in Modern Languages & Linguistics The Major in Modern Languages and Linguistics, which may be declared in the Department of World Languages, Oak Hall 107 or with the Program Advisor, offers an innovative, flexible, interdisciplinary curriculum that combines the study of modern languages, linguistics and communication. In order to play a meaningful role in world discourse, in order to protect our national security and in order to compete with our international counterparts in every field of study imaginable, the knowledge of modern languages is now a fundamental and indispensable part of every student’s education. As citizens of today’s world, students will benefit greatly from the study of modern languages, thus equipping them with the ability to communicate and interact with large populations of speakers coming from different cultural and ideological backgrounds. Additionally, through the completion of a core course in linguistics or anthropological linguistics and the option of completing additional electives in linguistics and communication, students will be able to put their specific language and culture studies into a broader context. Credits may be accepted via study abroad, through an Advanced Placement Examination, or via a CLEP Exam. Rowan University’s Testing Center (testingservices@rowan.edu), located in the Academic Success Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 304, offers the CLEP Exam in Spanish, French and German; depending on their scores, students may earn up to a maximum of 9 s.h. in each of these languages through the CLEP Exam. Students who enter the program with existing proficiency in their chosen languages will be required to meet with the primary faculty member(s) responsible for teaching those languages for a placement test/interview to determine initial course placement. Students may earn the credits for any courses skipped via the Authorization for Credit by Examination process. As an exit requirement, all students will be required to take Avant Assessment’s STAMP 4S as a final measure of proficiency in their Advanced Language for the program."
