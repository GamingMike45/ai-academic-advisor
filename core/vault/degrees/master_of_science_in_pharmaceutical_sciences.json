        "Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences": [
            "Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences Pharmaceutical Sciences is a highly interdisciplinary field that involves the integration of concepts from organic chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and molecular biology for the design and synthesis of drugs as well as for understanding the mechanism of drug action. Some of the primary goals of pharmaceutical sciences involve the discovery and development of novel drugs, efficient use of existing drugs, and lowering the cost of therapy employing cheaper protocols for manufacturing the drugs. The Master of Science (M.S.) in Pharmaceutical Sciences will provide the students with a solid foundation in basic chemistry and its applications in pharmaceutical sciences especially in the areas of research and development. Students will graduate with the necessary knowledge, skill sets, and training to effectively contribute to the development and characterization of new therapies for human disease and will be prepared for a career in pharmaceutical or biomedical research. Tracks The program includes two tracks. Each has different course and graduation exit requirements which are outlined below. Thesis Track: The thesis track is for students who desire to perform research as part of their graduate education. Thesis Track students enroll in 25 s.h. of core courses (including 9 s.h. of research) and 6 s.h. of restricted electives. These students must enroll full-time. This track is a Fellows-Eligible program and the students are considered for a Graduate Fellowship award. Non-Thesis Track: Non-Thesis Track students enroll in 16 s.h. of core courses and 15 s.h. of restricted electives. These students may enroll either part-time or full-time."
