            "Minor in German Studies The German Studies Minor, which may be declared in the Department of World Languages, Oak Hall 107 or by contacting the University Advising Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 323 (856.256.4459 / advise@rowan.edu), is an intensive program of study which offers courses in German language in addition to German civilization and culture and various interdisciplinary electives taught in English. It provides a general background for future professional studies and advanced degrees in German and work in a wide variety of fields, such as social, administrative and governmental work, as well as international business. This 18 s.h. minor is open to all students. A placement interview is strongly recommended for students with previous knowledge of German so that they may begin their German language study at the appropriate level. For placement interview information, please contact Dr. Edward Smith at smithe@rowan.edu. Students may earn the credits for any skipped courses via the Authorization for Credit by Examination process and these credits are counted in fulfillment of minor requirements. All courses must be passed with a letter grade of “C-” or better and no courses may be taken P/NC. Students may transfer credits into the German Studies Minor, including from Study Abroad and up to 9 s.h. from the CLEP Exam in German (equivalent to Elementary German I and II and Intermediate German I - contact the Testing Center, testingservices@rowan.edu, in the Academic Success Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 304, for more information). Students planning to Study Abroad must meet with their German Advisor in order to determine course equivalents."
