            "Bachelor of Arts in Wellness Management Wellness is a process of supporting, training and encouraging others in the pursuit of well-being in all dimensions of a person’s life, including the Social, Physical, Emotional, Occupational, Intellectual, Environmental and Spiritual. Personal health behavior is significant, as individuals are encouraged to adopt and maintain positive lifestyles through a variety of awareness, educational and motivational strategies. Personal behaviors must be supported by environments that are conducive to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Our B.A. in Wellness Management Program incorporates the Dimensions of Wellness philosophy as endorsed by the National Wellness Institute (NWI) and is aligned with the Wellness Promotion Competency Model identified by the NWI to enable graduates meet the criteria to become Certified Wellness Practitioners. Students are prepared to manage and facilitate wellness programs that address the overall well-being of individuals and groups in worksite, healthcare and community settings. The B.A. in Wellness Management requires students to earn a minor from a selected list of approved minors available at the University that reflect and support the professional competencies identified for the major.
