            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Jazz Performance The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Jazz Performance consists of applied lessons in jazz performance and improvisation, ensembles, and courses in jazz history and music theory. The program is available to both music majors and non-majors. The CUGS is intended to provide an opportunity for music majors studying performance in the European art music tradition to gain experience in jazz practices and styles, as well as to allow non-majors who played jazz in high school ensembles to continue their study of jazz performance. Students interested in the CUGS must audition with an applied music instructor before beginning applied lessons."
