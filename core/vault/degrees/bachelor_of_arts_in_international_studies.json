            "Bachelor of Arts in International Studies International Studies is an interdisciplinary major designed to engage students in an in-depth examination of international politics, economics, history, society, and culture. Students will pursue one of five concentrations: International Business and Economics, Global and Comparative Perspectives, Global Health, Global Security, or Middle East and African Studies. International Studies majors in all concentrations will gain an understanding of major global issues and analyze their own society in a broader global context; they will also learn how to apply interdisciplinary approaches to global problems and issues and acquire strong research, critical thinking, and communication skills. Students considering a major in International Studies are encouraged to consult with their advisor early in their academic career so they can develop a coherent program of study within their concentration. International Studies majors are very strongly encouraged to study abroad for at least a semester in a country relevant to their area of concentration. Students should also consider pursuing a double major in International Studies and another discipline to enhance their career prospects; students can complete all requirements to double major in International Studies and virtually any major in the College of Humanities & Social Sciences and Communication & Creative Arts within four years (120 credits). With careful planning, International Studies majors with a concentration in International Business and Economics could potentially earn a double major in the Rohrer College of Business such as Marketing, Management, or Entrepreneurship with 130 credits. International Studies majors must have a minimum 2.0 overall G.P.A. to qualify for graduation."
