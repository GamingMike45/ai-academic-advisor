            "Bachelor of Fine Arts in Biomedical Art & Visualization Accreditation: National arts accreditation has been granted by the National Association of Schools of Art & Design (NASAD) The Bachelor of Fine Arts in Biomedical Art & Visualization (BMAV) program integrates art, design, science, and medical content through advanced digital media and computer graphics technologies. Rooted in the traditions of scientific and medical illustration, the interdisciplinary curriculum emphasizes innovative digital approaches, preparing students for careers in medical, scientific, and technical visualization, including information design, animation, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and interactive educational applications. Students develop a strong foundation in both applied arts and sciences while gaining skills in digital painting and drawing, graphic design, 3D modeling, 2D/3D animation, interactive media, and data visualization. The curriculum includes coursework across multiple academic units to support cross-disciplinary training in both the sciences and visual communication. This degree provides students with preliminary training for a career as medical illustrators through coursework that prepares graduates for admission to graduate programs in medical illustration, which are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP). Graduates are equipped for a wide range of professional opportunities in industries such as hospitals and healthcare organizations, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, veterinary medicine, television and film, publishing (including journals, magazines, textbooks), advertising, research, museums, medical-legal and forensic visualization, instructional design, e-learning, and serious gaming."
