            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Sustainable Disaster Recovery & Community Resilience The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Sustainable Disaster Recovery & Community Resilience emphasizes the role of post-disaster recovery and sustainability.  Natural disasters (as well as non-natural disasters such as acts of terror and civil unrest in the aftermath of racial tension in the United States after the George Floyd death) such as floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and hurricanes result in devastating effects on people, economies, and the environment. This certificate of graduate study is designed to provide emergency managers with the necessary skills to help communities recover in a more sustainable and resilient manner to better understand the long-term disaster recovery and reconstruction challenges faced by communities affected by disasters."
