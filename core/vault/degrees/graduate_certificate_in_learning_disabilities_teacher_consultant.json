            "Graduate Certificate in Learning Disabilities Teacher Consultant Learning Disabilities Teacher-Consultants work in collaboration with other members of a child study team to determine eligibility for special services. LDT-Cs also consult with parents, teachers, and other school personnel to provide research-based instructional strategies to assist pupils struggling academically. Applicants who have earned a master’s degree in education from another institution, or a master’s degree in a related field (e.g., Special Education or Reading), may apply to the Learning Disabilities Teacher Consultant (LDTC) certification program. This program meets all State of New Jersey requirements for the LDT-C certificate. It also received national recognition for accreditation through CEC for educational diagnosticians."
