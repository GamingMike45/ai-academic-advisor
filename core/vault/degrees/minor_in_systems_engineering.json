            "Minor in Systems Engineering Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem that includes - operations, cost & schedule, performance, training & support, test, disposal, and manufacturing. Systems Engineering integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. Systems Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs. In addition, Systems Engineering incorporates concepts of “balanced design” - achieving a product design that meets requirements but does not exceed them, and does so within the constraints of cost, schedule & performance, including life cycle costs; and “risk assessment & management” - understanding the technical and other risks that may be involved and managing the design to effectively mitigate the risks. Minor in Systems Engineering consists of a total of 24 credits, 12 coming from required courses and 12 from electives as follows. Not all courses are offered in all semesters, please check Section Tally and plan accordingly."

Therefore, check with ECE Department Head to verify that the specific ECE 09402 you are interested will qualify as a Systems Engineering elective. *** ECE 09.4XX ECE Department regularly offers senior electives on topics that are very relevant to Systems Engineering. Please check with ECE Department Chair for approved 400-level courses that can be used as a Systems Engineering elective.
