            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences, Doctor of Medicine The Department of Biological & Biomedical Sciences and the Cooper Medical School at Rowan University (CMSRU) offer a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences and a Doctor of Medicine degree, respectively. This accelerated program allows high-achieving Biological Sciences majors to obtain the Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Medicine in seven years, rather than the traditional period of eight years if both degrees were completed separately. The program is a 3 + 4 arrangement where students begin Doctor of Medicine courses in their 4th year at Rowan University. Individuals are eligible to apply during the early fall semester of their senior year of high school, and this program is not open to current Rowan University students."
