            "Master of Science in Complex Biological Systems Modern societal challenges in biological sciences are complex and transcend scale; they also rapidly evolve. Solutions to complex biological problems require multi level understanding, from molecular and atomic levels to populations and ecosystems, technologies that operate across these scales, and teams that cover all scales. The Complex Biological Systems M.S. program is use-oriented, problem-focused, and emphasizes the scales of societal problems (from molecules to ecological systems) and the connections between these scales. This program brings together interdisciplinary faculty mentors with overlapping big-picture goals and complementary skill sets, providing students with diverse cutting-edge research and educational experiences. The Thesis Track M.S. will allow students an opportunity for focused laboratory research with supportive coursework. Tracks The program includes two tracks. Each has different course and graduation exit requirements which are outlined below. Thesis Track: The thesis track is for students who desire to perform research as part of their graduate education. Thesis Track students enroll in 18 s.h. of core courses, a minimum of 9 s.h. of research courses, and 3 s.h. of restricted electives. Non-Thesis Track: Non-Thesis Track students enroll in 18 s.h. of core courses and 12 s.h. of restricted electives."
