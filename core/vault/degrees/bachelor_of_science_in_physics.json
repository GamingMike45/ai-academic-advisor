            "Bachelor of Science in Physics The Bachelor of Science Program in Physics prepares students for graduate school in physics or engineering, professional schools, and for careers in industry, government, business, or teaching - students interested in teaching should consider the Master of Arts in STEM Education in an Accelerated Dual Degree Program. Students may also think about the Accelerated Dual Degree Program with the Masters of Science in Data Science. Undergraduate research opportunities exist in diverse areas of experimental physics including optics/laser spectroscopy, condensed matter/materials science, biophysics, theoretical physics including optical physics and high-energy physics, and planetary science/astronomy. Access to these kinds of meaningful experiences is a hallmark of the Physics Program."
