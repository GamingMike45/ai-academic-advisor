            "Master of Arts in Holocaust & Genocide Education The Masters of Arts in Holocaust & Genocide Education prepares its students to create lessons, develop curricula and programs, and evaluate curricula and programs in Holocaust & Genocide Education. It brings deep content knowledge together with a strong constructivist pedagogy in order to help students consider what Holocaust & genocide education might look like across diverse settings. Additionally, this is an essential program, as New Jersey is one of eight states with a Holocaust & genocide teaching mandate, which requires P-12 teachers to teach about the Holocaust & genocides “at the earliest possible moment.”"
