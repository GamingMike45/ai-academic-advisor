            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Soft Robotics The CUGS in Soft Robotics offers students an opportunity to learn the concepts, principles, systems, and applications of soft robotics. Soft robotics, a fast-growing subfield under robotics, focuses on robots made of soft materials. Many innovations in soft robotics have been inspired by elements and systems in nature, especially animals’ soft structures. In comparison to the traditional rigid-body robots, soft robots can better adapt to unpredictable environments to perform challenging tasks due to their inherent flexibility. This CUGS allows students to take additional specialized coursework related to the field of Soft Robotics."
