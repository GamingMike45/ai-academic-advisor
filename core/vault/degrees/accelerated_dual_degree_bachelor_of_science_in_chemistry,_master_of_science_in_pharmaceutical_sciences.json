            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences Overview The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry currently offers a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Chemistry as well as a Master of Science (MS) in Pharmaceutical Sciences. High-achieving Rowan Chemistry majors can obtain the BS and MS (non-thesis track) in a five-year period (rather than the traditional period of six years if both degrees were completed independently). This would create a “3+2” program in which students would be enrolled as undergraduates in the first semester of their fourth year but would enroll as graduate students in the second semester of the 4th year. By beginning graduate-level studies in their fourth year, highly talented and motivated students will be able to complete both degrees on an accelerated timeline. The BS/MS dual degree program will enable students to obtain advanced graduate level training in the pharmaceutical sciences, which will prepare them for careers in industry or further graduate study. Identification of Courses The courses required for graduation is a combination of the required courses for the complete core of the BS Chemistry degree including Rowan general education courses (108 credits) as well as the full 31 credits for the MS  Pharmaceutical Sciences (non-thesis track) degree. This intends to use up to 12 credits of the MS courses toward fulfilling the required 120 credits for undergraduate degree completion. The complete program will consist of 139 credits for the dual BS and MS degrees as opposed to 151 credits if both were done independently."

                "Total Required Credits for the Program: 139 s.h. Requirements for Admission and Graduation Admission Applicants to the accelerated program will submit all application materials by January 15 of the spring semester of their third year at Rowan (nominally “junior” year). The graduate admissions committee in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry will review the applications and students will be notified by February 1. We plan to revisit and potentially fine-tune the details of the admission process two or three years after implementation to take into account the practical aspects that might arise during the first few rounds of applications. Application for admission requires: A minimum overall GPA of 2.8 in undergraduate coursework A complete online CGCE application including personal statement A letter of nomination/recommendation from Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry Graduation To graduate from the accelerated BS/MS (non-thesis) dual degree program in Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, students must meet the following requirements: Completion of all program requirements for the BS in Chemistry (maintain cumulative GPA of 2.0). Completion of all program requirements for the MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences (non-thesis) (maintain cumulative GPA of 3.0 as well as obtain no grade less than B- in any of the graduate courses). Maintain satisfactory progress through the program. Upon completion of the requirements above, the student will be granted both a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and a Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences. Student Status Students enrolled in the accelerated BS/MS Program will pay undergraduate fees for the first four years of the program and they will start paying the graduate tuition starting in their fifth year. Students will be allowed to register for 6 s.h. of graduate courses for two semesters in their undergraduate senior year (nominally the fourth year). Students must maintain full time student status during the entire 5-year program. Students will be expected to maintain satisfactory progress through the program. Satisfactory progress will be defined by the following parameters: Earning at least a grade of B- in all the graduate courses. Any student who fails to maintain satisfactory progress as described above will be placed on probation within the program for one semester- if the performance still does not improve, he/she will be dropped from the graduate program. If the student has not already earned the BS in Chemistry, he/she will be re-admitted into the BS subject to the requirements of that program. Students with extenuating circumstances may request an exception to this requirement by obtaining written approval of the Program Coordinator of MS Pharmaceutical Sciences as well as their Undergraduate Advisor, and other approvals if needed under University policy. Students who enter the accelerated MS program but do not maintain satisfactory progress or opt-out of the MS degree will be allowed to apply up to 12 credits of Pharmaceutical Sciences coursework credits as restricted or free electives toward the BS Chemistry degree. If the student opts out before 12 credits have been completed in the Pharmaceutical Sciences program, any remaining credits to make up the required 120 credits for the undergraduate BS Chemistry degree will be taken using traditional coursework at the Glassboro campus.",
