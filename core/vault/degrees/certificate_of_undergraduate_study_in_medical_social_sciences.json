            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Medical Social Sciences The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Medical Social Sciences provides students with greater depth in understanding the social factors affecting health behavior, attitudes, and organizations. The Association of American Medical Colleges recognizes the importance of such understanding for medical school students, covering related topics on its Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) entrance exam. There are many health-related careers that do not require medical school. Such careers include (but are not limited to) allied health, public health and policy, and community health organization."
