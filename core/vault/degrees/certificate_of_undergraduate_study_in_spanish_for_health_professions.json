                "Total Required Credits for the Program: 12 s.h. Students with existing proficiency in Spanish should contact Esther Mas (mas@rowan.edu) regarding the placement exam. Students may place into any of the first five semester levels of Spanish language, as high as Spanish Reading and Composition (SPAN 05212). It is possible for students to earn credits for the courses that they skip via the Authorization for Credit by Examination process. Contact Esther Mas (mas@rowan.edu) for more details about this option. Students without existing proficiency in Spanish will first need to complete 12 s.h. of lower-level coursework in Spanish, including Spanish I (SPAN 05101), Spanish II (SPAN 05102), Spanish III (SPAN 05201), and Spanish Reading and Conversation (SPAN 05211). Students may satisfy program requirements through coursework completed at Rowan University, transfer credits obtained from coursework at other institutions, or through study abroad. All courses must be passed with a letter grade of “C-” or better and no courses may be taken P/NC. Students planning to study abroad must meet with the Program Mentor in order to determine course equivalents. Non-matriculated students may also earn the Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Spanish for Health Professions. Marilyn S.
