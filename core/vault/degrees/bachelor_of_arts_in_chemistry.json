            "Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry The Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry prepares students for science, business, or law careers. The BA can also be combined with the Master of Arts in STEM Education in an Accelerated Dual Degree Program for students interested in teaching high school Chemistry. This 5-year program allows students to earn both degrees and teaching certification with 1 (or even 2) fewer years than the standard path. The Master of Arts in STEM Education is described in the Graduate Catalog under the College of Education. Laboratories are equipped with modern instrumentation and computers for hands-on use by students at all levels. Each student is expected to carry out a laboratory-based research project."
