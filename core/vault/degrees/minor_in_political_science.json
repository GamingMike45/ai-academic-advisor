            "Minor in Political Science The minor program in political science supplements the curriculum of students majoring outside of political science; it helps students expand their career options into such fields as law, journalism, social studies teaching, business, government, and intelligence. The minor requires 21 s.h. of political science courses. Twelve of those semester hours are in basic courses which are required of all who pursue a political science minor, while the other nine are political science electives that students can tailor to their particular career or intellectual interests."
