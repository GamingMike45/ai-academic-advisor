            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Crisis Communication This 12-credit certificate prepares the student from any major of study to assess, prepare, and manage critical messages in both internal and external crisis situations that may affect industries across a wide variety of disciplines. A certificate in crisis communication allows students to experience the specialty area of crisis management/crisis communication and understand not only the theory but also the strategic practice of managing and disseminating information during emergencies or critical events. Crisis communicators allow an organization to minimize damage, maintain public trust, and protect its reputation. Students in this certificate program can serve an internship at a crisis communication agency for experiential learning."
