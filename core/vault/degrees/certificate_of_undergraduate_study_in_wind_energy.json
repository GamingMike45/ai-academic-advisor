            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Wind Energy The Murphy Administration has set forth the New Jersey Energy Master Plan, which will put the state onto a path towards 100% clean energy by 2050. Offshore wind has the potential to supply substantial amounts of clean energy to meet the State’s and the Nation’s power needs while creating jobs and addressing the climate crisis. Short- and medium-term workforce needs have been identified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NERL) with the offshore wind industry alone expected to provide approximately 7,000 new jobs in Southern New Jersey by 2028. Electrical and Computer Engineering program, in collaboration with Mechanical Engineering, will be offering a Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in wind energy, consisting of four courses (12-13 credit hours). This CUGS is designed to provide a breadth and depth to students who want to specialize in wind energy systems and prepare them for a career in the wind energy industry. This particular CUGS and its courses are designed for undergraduate students, with projects in each of its required courses that are commensurate with their background."

Some courses may have prerequisites. Students should check for these prerequisites carefully. Double counting policy : For all CUGS offered by the ECE Department, at most two courses can be double counted to satisfy the CUGS and the B.S. in ECE degree requirements. Therefore, ECE students pursuing this CUGS must take at least two courses above and beyond their BS in ECE degree requirements. CS (or other non-ECE) courses that are at 300 or lower level cannot be counted towards BS in ECE degree requirements. The ECE program accepts at most one non-ECE course to be taken in lieu of senior ECE electives subject to the following conditions: 1) the class must be technical in nature that is reasonably relevant to ECE and/or engineering (department must pre-approve); and 2) the class must be a 400-level class. Non-ECE students who pursue this CUGS should follow the course double-counting policies of the department in which their major resides.
