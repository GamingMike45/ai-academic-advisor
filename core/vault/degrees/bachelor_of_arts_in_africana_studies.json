            "Bachelor of Arts in Africana Studies Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary major designed to engage undergraduate students in a critical examination of past and contemporary challenges, experiences and contributions of people of African descent throughout the world. Hence the program is both national and international in scope. The program emphasizes two major goals: (1) discovering, mastering and creating knowledge and (2) using those understandings and skills in service to institutions and communities. Students are required to take 12 Africana Electives from two different banks: Africana and Comparative/World Electives. To maximize their career path options, students will be able to take the Africana Studies Major with a minor in one of the academic disciplines or as a double major. Graduates with a Bachelor Degree in Africana Studies will have the intellectual, technical, and social competencies to be competitive as applicants for employment and graduate or professional study in the US or abroad in a broad range of fields including: Education, law and justice, business, international affairs, federal and state public services, politics, social work, public administration, library and museum services, health sciences and public health, theatre, psychology and the social sciences, economic development, non-profit management, writing, journalism, ethnic studies, and the arts. The program promotes regular academic advising and consultation with the program coordinator or other faculty and staff to enable students to follow a clear sequence of courses both in general education and the major. This is especially essential for students pursuing a double major, who will need assistance in fulfilling the requirements of both majors by utilizing the flexibility provided in the current model of general education."
