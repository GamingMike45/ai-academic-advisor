            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Ancient Egyptian Studies The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Ancient Egyptian Studies allows Rowan students with an interest in the archaeology, art history, and history of ancient North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Near East to receive specialized training in one of the rigorous and fascinating subfields of that area. Students may concentrate their studies in historical, archaeological, or museum studies aspects of this discipline, gaining exposure to these career fields. The certificate program provides multiple opportunities for experiential learning including museum-based research making use of the ongoing faculty-led project at the University of Pennsylvania’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Additional experiential opportunities include the observation of archaeological, historical, and museum-based research in Egypt with the additional opportunity to participate in an archaeological excavation in Egypt as part of a research internship. While not required, the certificate would encourage students to take multiple semesters of Arabic to ensure that they can take full advantage of the learning opportunities in the faculty-led study abroad elective or the fieldwork-based internship in Egypt should they choose to enroll in those courses. These learning experiences would give students a definite advantage in applying for advanced degree programs in Anthropology, Art History, Egyptology, History, and Museum Studies. The Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Ancient Egyptian Studies is 15 s.h., five courses:"
