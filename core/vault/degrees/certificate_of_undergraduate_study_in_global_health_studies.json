It should be noted that some elective courses do have prerequisites as established by the departments or programs that oversee them. According to University policy, students may only double count two courses from another single major, minor, or CUGS in fulfilling the requirements for this CUGS. Students in the CUGS should work with their academic advisor and with the coordinator of International Studies to determine the selection and sequence of coursework for the CUGS that best meets their needs.
