            "Master of Science in Materials Science & Engineering The M.S. in Materials Science & Engineering program allows students to obtain advanced knowledge in materials and expand their skill sets in emerging topics of interest. This interdisciplinary program covers a wide variety of topics such as material properties, experimental techniques, fabrication and characterization of materials, novel materials, and material-related applications. The program will prepare students with the necessary knowledge and skills for careers in materials science and engineering. Thesis and non-thesis (course-only) tracks are available, both of which require a total of 30 credits. For the thesis track, 9 of the 30 credits come from original research that culminates in a thesis. For the non-thesis option, all 30 credits come from coursework. Tracks The program includes two tracks - a thesis track and a non-thesis track. Non-Thesis Track: Students choosing the non-thesis track take 30 credits of traditional (non-thesis) courses. Thesis Track: Students choosing the thesis track will also take 30 credits, but they will substitute between 9 credits of thesis courses for traditional (non-thesis) courses."
