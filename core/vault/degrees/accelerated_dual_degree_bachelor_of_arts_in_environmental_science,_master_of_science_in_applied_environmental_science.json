            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Science, Master of Science in Applied Environmental Science This accelerated dual degree program creates a pathway for motivated and high-achieving Rowan Environmental Science majors to obtain both a B.A. in Environmental Science and a M.S. in Applied Environmental Science in five-years rather than the traditional six if both degrees were completed independently. Students will begin graduate-level coursework in their fourth year and these credits will apply to both the undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The B.A. in Environmental Science offers students the additional flexibility to pursue minors and/or concentrations in adjacent fields further broadening their theoretical and practical skills. Through classroom, field, and applied experiences, students in this accelerated dual degree program will acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to establish and advance their careers in environmental science in a wide range of professional settings including industry, consulting, education, and policy or further their academic training in a doctoral program."

                "Total Required Credits for the Entire ADD Program: 138 s.h. Requirements for Admission The admission requirements for the B.A. Environmental Science (2235)/M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) Program are as follows: Students may be admitted to this program as early as the summer after their freshman year (30 credits). Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible to ensure timely completion of the program, but assuming they’ve taken the required courses listed below, they may apply at a later point. Transfer students with at least 30 credits may apply after they have earned at least 15 credits at Rowan, i.e. in their second semester at Rowan. Students must earn a C minimum grade in M.S. prerequisite courses as noted below and at least a C in all courses that count towards the B.A. in Environmental Science (2235) major. Sophomore Admission : After completing their freshman year or 30 credits, students who meet the criteria listed below may apply to this program: Minimum overall GPA of 3.0 in undergraduate coursework. Junior Admission : After earning 60 credits, students who apply to the program must meet the criteria listed below: Minimum overall GPA of 3.0 in undergraduate coursework Completion of EVSC 01202 Environmental Science Research Methods and Data Analysis and EVSC 01220 Global Climate Crisis with at least a C Requirements for beginning the M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) program as a Senior (90 credits): To begin the M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) program in their senior year, students who have been accepted into this accelerated dual degree program must meet the criteria listed below. The coordinator of the M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) program will assess whether the student has met the requirements necessary to begin taking M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) courses. The coordinator of Environmental Science programs will assess the student’s record in the B.A. in Environmental Science (2235). Minimum overall GPA of 3.0 in undergraduate coursework Completion of at least 6 of the M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) prerequisite courses listed Graduation Requirements To graduate from this accelerated dual degree program with a B.A. in Environmental Science (2235) and a M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) students must: Complete all requirements for the B.A. Environmental Science (2235), including General Education and Rowan Experience requirements Complete all prerequisites M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) program Complete all requirements for the M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) Achieve a 3.0 overall GPA in the M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) with no grade lower than C and no more than two Cs. Student Status and Contingency Plan Students will be expected to maintain satisfactory progress through the program, maintain an overall 3.0 GPA in undergraduate coursework, earn at least B’s in all M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) prerequisite courses, and meet the criteria for the M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) (i.e. achieve a 3.0 overall GPA with no grade lower than C and no more than two C’s). Any student who fails to maintain satisfactory progress as described above will be placed on probation within the program for one semester. If the student’s performance still does not improve, they will be dropped from the accelerated program. Students with documented extenuating circumstances may request an exception to this requirement by obtaining written approval of the M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) Coordinator. Students enrolled in this accelerated B.A. Environmental Science (2235)/M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) program may take up to 12 credits of graduate courses at the undergraduate rate in their senior year providing they meet the criteria listed above. Students may count up to 12 credits of their graduate courses towards their B.A. in Environmental Science (2235) requirements; 6 credits will count as restricted electives and 6 credits will count as free electives towards the 120 credits required for a B.A. in Environmental Science (2235) Beyond this, students will pay graduate tuition rates for their M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) courses. Students who are dropped from the accelerated graduate program or choose not to complete the B.A. Environmental Science (2235)/M.S. in Applied Environmental Science (G218) accelerated dual degree program may earn a B.A. in Environmental Science (2235) once they have completed all requirements for that undergraduate degree, achieved at least a 2.0 GPA, and earned at least 120 credits. Students may count up to 12 credits of their graduate courses towards their B.A. in Environmental Science (2235) requirements; 6 credits will count as restricted electives and 6 credits will count as free electives towards the 120 credits required for a B.A. in Environmental Science (2235).
