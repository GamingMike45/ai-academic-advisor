            "Certificate of Graduate Study in School Emergency Preparedness & Response Leadership Rowan University’s Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in School Emergency Preparedness & Response Leadership will be at the forefront filling gaps between all services commissioned to protect academic institutions by offering unique courses that detail preparedness and prevention in school settings. This program is not designed to teach school administrators specific first responder tasks, but rather to help teachers, school administrators, and education officials build a culture of school preparedness and safety in the event of natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, or earthquakes), technological disasters (nuclear power plant emergencies or hazardous materials spills), or hostage situations."
