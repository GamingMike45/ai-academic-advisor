            "Master of Science in Bioinformatics The Master of Science in Bioinformatics (M.S.) produces highly trained students who are prepared to immediately contribute in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and biomedical fields. Bioinformatics is a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on the use of computational information tools in the investigation and analysis of biological, biomedical, and biochemical systems. The goal of the field is to use information generated in the lab or clinic for future applications, research, and development. The M.S. in Bioinformatics at Rowan University provides hands-on experience so students can perform novel research. This includes advanced training in theory and laboratory settings to allow students to diversify into other biomedical research fields. This program includes the following three (3) focus areas: Biochemistry, Biological Sciences and Computer Science. Tracks The program includes two tracks. Each has different course and graduation exit requirements which are outlined below. Thesis Track: Thesis Track students enroll in 12 s.h. of core courses, a minimum of 12 - 15 s.h. of thesis courses, and 3 - 6 s.h. of restricted electives, depending on focus area selected. Non-Thesis Track: Non-Thesis Track students enroll in 12 s.h. of core courses and 18 s.h. of restricted electives, depending on focus area selected. Non-thesis students may choose to take a maximum of 6 s.h. of thesis research courses. Rowan University undergraduates majoring in the Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics program can apply to the accelerated Bachelor of Science/Master of Science Advanced Dual Degree (4+1) program, allowing them to earn both the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in five years."
