            "Bachelor of Arts in Biological Sciences Students majoring in Biology are required to take a four-semester introductory sequence. While this sequence offers greater content knowledge coverage compared to a traditional Biology I & II sequence, it also includes extensive development of skills in the areas of reading and researching primary literature, scientific writing, experimental design, and data analysis. Beyond the core sequence, majors for the Bachelor of Arts must take an additional 15 semester hours of Biology courses which must include at least three different 300-level laboratory courses. A course in Special Topics in Biological Sciences is required during the student’s Senior year. A grade of C or higher must be earned in each biology course. The BA can also be combined with the Master of Arts in STEM Education in an Accelerated Dual Degree Program. This 5-year program allows students to earn both degrees and teaching certification with 1 (or even 2) fewer years than the standard path. The Master of Arts in STEM Education is described in the Graduate Catalog under the College of Education. The Department of Biological & Biomedical Sciences advises all students that all Biology courses may require observation of, dissection of, manipulation of and experimentation with living or preserved organisms. These exercises are an integral part of biology courses and provide an essential experience."
