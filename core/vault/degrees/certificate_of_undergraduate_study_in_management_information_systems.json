            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Management Information Systems The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Management Information Systems is primarily for non-business majors who are interested in learning how information systems can be used to support business operations and achieve organizational strategy. The two required courses in the CUGS introduce students to the basic business functions and address the key components of information systems - organizations, people, software, hardware, data, and telecommunications - and how these components can be integrated and managed to play an essential role in creating competitive advantage. Students will then be able to choose two electives depending on what area of information systems they would like to further explore."
