            "Minor in Education The major goals of the Minor in Education are three-fold: Create an avenue for students at Rowan who have an interest in Education but do not want to complete a full BA in Education. This work will be noted on their transcripts as a Minor. Create an avenue for Internal/External Transfer Candidates (for P-3, K-6, and P-12 Subject-Matter) to complete a Minor rather than spending a minimum of 4 additional semesters to complete the Major in Education. Candidates who are not currently Education majors but who are interested in becoming Early Childhood (P-3), Elementary (K-6) or Subject-Matter (P-12) Education majors via the internal transfer process; Create an avenue for students who leave the program having completed most, if not all, of the courses in the proposed major including all required courses for the minor, to have an official designation for their work in Education."
