            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Ethics The Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Ethics (CUGS) is a multi-departmental program designed to complement and enhance a student’s major program, as well as to prepare students for graduate studies and professional careers. A certificate in ethics will appeal to students across the Rowan campus especially since most employers require ethics training and understanding. This certificate will expose students to analysis of ethical theories and teach students how to apply those theories in professional practice. Students can choose specific applied ethics courses related to business, medicine, and the environment. Students will develop an awareness of how their actions affect others on a local and global level."
