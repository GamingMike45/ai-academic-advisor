            "Minor in Spanish The Spanish Minor, which may be declared in the Department of World Languages, Oak Hall 107 or by contacting the University Advising Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 323 (856.256.4459 / advise@rowan.edu), offers a flexible curriculum with many opportunities for selection of courses in the Spanish language and in Spanish and Spanish American civilization, culture, literature and linguistics. It provides a general background for future professional studies and advanced degrees in Spanish and work in a wide variety of fields, such as social, administrative and governmental work, as well as international business. This 18 s.h. minor is open to all students. A placement exam is strongly recommended so that students may begin the minor at the appropriate level. For placement exam information, please contact Esther Mas Serna at mas@rowan.edu. Students may earn the credits for any skipped courses via the Authorization for Credit by Examination process and these credits are counted in fulfillment of minor requirements. All courses must be passed with a letter grade of “C-” or better and no courses may be taken P/NC. Students may transfer credits into the Spanish Minor, including from Study Abroad and up to 9 s.h. from the CLEP Exam in Spanish (equivalent to Spanish I, II and III - contact the Testing Center, testingservices@rowan.edu, in the Academic Success Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 304, for more information). Students planning to Study Abroad must meet with Esther Mas (mas@rowan.edu) in order to determine course equivalents."
