            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Italian The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Italian may be declared in the Department of World Languages, Oak Hall 107, or by contacting the University Advising Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 323 (856-256-4459 / advise@rowan.edu). This program recognizes students’ completion of 12 s.h. in Italian, which corresponds to Intermediate-level proficiency in the language. Intermediate-level proficiency in a world language is a valuable credential, as it represents the ability to live independently in a foreign country with a substantial degree of success. In general, according to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), Intermediate-level speakers are able to create with the language, combining and recombining learned material to provide personal information, speak in sentences on a variety of familiar topics, ask questions, initiate, sustain and conclude a simple social or transactional task. For more information visit our website, Department of World Languages or contact the Department for the latest details."

                "Total Required Credits for the Program: 12 s.h. Students may satisfy program requirements through coursework completed at Rowan University, transfer credits obtained from coursework at other institutions, credits obtained through Advanced Placement (up to 12 s.h. are accepted at Rowan in place of the four courses listed above), and study abroad. Credits obtained from higher level coursework in Italian may also be substituted for any of the four courses listed above. A placement interview is strongly recommended for students with existing proficiency in Italian. For placement exam information, please contact Dr. Alessandra Mirra at mirra@rowan.edu; students may earn the credits for any courses skipped via the Authorization for Credit by Examination process and these credits also count toward the program. All courses must be passed with a letter grade of “C-” or better and no courses may be taken P/NC. Students planning to study abroad must meet with the Program Mentor in order to determine course equivalents. Non-matriculated students may also earn the Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Italian.
