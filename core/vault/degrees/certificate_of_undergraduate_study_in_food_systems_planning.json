            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Food Systems Planning Food systems planning is an emergent subfield of planning that has gained popularity among the planning community through the recognition of the economic, environmental and social benefits of a strong regional food system. This recognition has led to the rise of planning-related policies and programs that focus on supporting regionally-based food supply chains and developing a strong regional food identity. The American Planning Association is now incorporating food systems planning as an important dimension of its advocacy and professional training. The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Food Systems Planning provides students with a foundation in community and regional planning concepts along with a specific focus on how food can foster community and individual-level health, local and regional economic development, and food justice. This CUGS complements the other programs already being offered in the GPS department, and will add to students’ in other departments’ degree experiences by adding an explicit focus on community and environmental planning topics related to community and regional food systems."
