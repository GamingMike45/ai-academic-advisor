            "Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship The theory and practice of entrepreneurship is becoming increasingly important for solving economic and social challenges. We develop the ability of our students to identify, determine feasibility and act upon entrepreneurial opportunities. Student learning is infused with an emphasis on innovation, entrepreneurial thinking and venture effectiveness using entrepreneurial problems, cases, and project-based learning. These exposures provide students with the foundation to initiate new enterprises, create socially responsible non-profit entities, extend family ventures or craft corporate extensions. Students working toward a Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship must maintain a 2.00 grade point average overall and a 2.50 grade point average in all business courses taken."
