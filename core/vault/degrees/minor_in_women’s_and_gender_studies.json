                "Minor in Women’s & Gender Studies The Women’s & Gender Studies program offers an interdisciplinary global minor, with courses open to students in all majors. Courses from the minor may also be used as electives or as part of the general education requirements. The major objectives of the minor are to increase knowledge about women and gender; to examine women’s and men’s roles across disciplines; to stimulate re-evaluations of the gender roles in society; to increase awareness of the status of women globally; and to value the contributions of women across cultures and time periods. Women’s & Gender Studies courses provide an opportunity for intensive study and in-depth analysis. The successful completion of eighteen (18) semester hours, including the core course, is required. Students interested in pursuing a minor should contact the Coordinator of the program for further information and advisement. They should also declare the minor through the University Advising Center. Each student enrolled in the Women’s & Gender Studies minor is required to: Take the core course, Women and Gender in Perspective OR Honors Women and Gender in Perspective (INTR 01130) Take fifteen (15) credits of approved Women’s & Gender Studies courses (ranked First and Second Tier) of which nine (9) credits must be from the First Tier. If a student is taking a course that has significant gender content but is not listed below, please contact the Coordinator to consider the course for fulfilling program requirements."
