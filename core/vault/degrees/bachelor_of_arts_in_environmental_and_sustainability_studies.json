            "Bachelor of Arts in Environmental & Sustainability Studies The BA in Environmental & Sustainability Studies (BAESS) is an opportunity to explore humanity’s relationship with the natural world from a range of perspectives in the social sciences and humanities. BAESS is designed to complement more technical studies in the physical sciences or engineering with a focus on the human context of environmental problems; at the same time, BAESS offers students in humanities, social sciences, education, communications, and artistic programs a clear topical focus for their work, emphasizing environmental issues and humanity’s relationship with the natural world. BAESS is also a great option for students interested in environmental policy. The BAESS program is designed with great flexibility in mind: and students will have ample flexibility in their schedules to pursue an additional major, minors, CUGS, and anything else that suits students’ interests and career plans. Environmental problems are priority issues of local, national, and global concern. Core courses emphasize major issues and approaches in environmental studies, along with establishing a foundation in social science and humanistic research design. Elective courses offer students the chance to explore the Environmental Humanities, Environmental Policy & Economics, and Applications of Environmental & Sustainability Studies. BAESS’ internship requirement offers students a chance to apply their classroom education in the ‘real world’. Graduates of the program will be well-suited for a variety of careers working with the environment, especially those in government, non-profit, and environmental education sectors, and also strong candidates for graduate studies in a range of fields."
