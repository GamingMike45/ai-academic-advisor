            "Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Pre-Health Studies The Pre-Health Studies Post-Baccalaureate is designed for individuals who are interested in a career in the health professions but have little or no background in science. The coursework focuses on the foundational prerequisites required of health profession schools including but not limited to medical and dental school. The curriculum is paired with an advisor who will help develop academic and experiential learning goals, support programming from the Office of Pre-Health, discounted admission exam preparation course options, and application support including a University Committee Letter. The program is tailored to each individual student based on their health-related professional goals. Upon completion of the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Pre-Health Studies, students will demonstrate knowledge of scientific foundations, including fundamentals of chemistry, biology, and physics, needed to succeed on the admissions test and the future health professional curriculum. Available targeted health profession routes include but are not limited to medical, dental, optometry, physician assistant, and physical therapy. For students seeking Grade Enhancer programs, we encourage you to explore the CMSRU post-baccalaureate Advanced PreMedical Studies certificate or the Certificate of Graduate Study in Biomedical Sciences or Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences."
