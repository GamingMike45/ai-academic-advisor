Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 in Rowan University coursework. (Transfer courses/credit do not count toward the RU GPA.) A minimum of 30 s.h. of coursework must be completed at/through Rowan University. Only grades of “D-” or above may apply to graduation/degree requirements. (Some programs may set higher minimums.) Students must meet the Rowan Core and Rowan Experience Requirements. An individual course can potentially satisfy one Rowan Core literacy and/or multiple Rowan Experience attributes. Rowan Core & Rowan Experience designations are listed in course details in Section Tally (www.rowan.edu/registrar) and may also be searched on that site under “Attributes.” A list of Rowan Core courses is here: https://confluence.rowan.edu/display/AS/Rowan+Core+Course+List. Students must apply for graduation and should do so for the term in which they will complete all program requirements."
