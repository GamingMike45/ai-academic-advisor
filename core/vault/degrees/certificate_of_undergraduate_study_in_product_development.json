            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Product Development The Product Development Process is an integral part of any engineering environment. As such, the skills provided with this Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Product Development can be leveraged to provide additional value to not just the Engineering Entrepreneurship, but all Engineering curriculums, allowing students to be valued member of a hiring organization and not just the engineering departments within that organization. In addition, the proposed CUGS will teach students essential product development skills and contribute their learned expertise to the development of internal and external products."
