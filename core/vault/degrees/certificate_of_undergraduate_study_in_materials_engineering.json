Approval is granted on an individual basis, following consultation with the clinic project manager. Clinic projects that involve components related to the discovery, design, or characterization of materials, with an emphasis on solids, will qualify for CUGS credit. **The two electives for the CUGS are chosen from an approved list. Available electives depend on the semester offering with Engineering and the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry.
