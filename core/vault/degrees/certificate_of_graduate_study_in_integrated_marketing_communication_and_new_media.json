            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Integrated Marketing Communication & New Media The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Integrated Marketing Communication & New Media provides insight into how company efforts to offer greater accountability from their marketing efforts have intensified, and how new media have proliferated. This has intensified the search for new ways to get more accountability from marketing communication efforts. The result has been a growing understanding on the part of corporate management that (1) the efficiencies of mass media advertising are not what they used to be; (2) consumers are more sophisticated, cynical, and distrusting than ever before; (3) tremendous gaps exist between what companies say in their advertising and what they actually do; and (4) in the long run, nourishing good customer relationships is far more important than making simple exchanges. There is now a growing movement toward integrating all the messages created by various communication agencies and sent out by various departments within the company to achieve consistency. This process is known as Integrated Marketing Communication. Students can use the coursework from this Certificate of Graduate Study and apply it toward the Master of Arts in Strategic Communication program."
