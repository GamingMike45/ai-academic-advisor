            "Master of Science in Cybersecurity The Master of Science in Cybersecurity will prepare students with the knowledge and skills needed to understand key issues along with present and emerging cyber threats to information systems, develop graduates with a sufficiently broad and strong technical foundation to understand and analyze cybersecurity vulnerabilities and protections and prepare students for specialized cybersecurity careers. Rowan University undergraduates majoring in the Bachelor of Arts in Computing & Informatics program may apply to the Accelerated Dual Degree (ADD) program, which allows them to earn both the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Science degrees in five years instead of six. The M.S. in Cybersecurity is a 31-credit-hour program. All students must complete 6 credits of foundation courses (2 courses) and 13 credits of core courses (5 courses). Students may complete this degree within 1 ½ to 2 years of study."
