            "Note: If students hold National Board certification, two courses in the Core/Teacher Leadership Certificate of Graduate Study will be waived. *During the final semester of their studies, students will work closely with a faculty member to conduct a scholarly self-study that examines how their emerging teacher leadership skills reflects the standards that guide the program and current research in teacher leadership. This Self-Study will result in the production of a Synthesis Portfolio, a visual or graphic organizer, and a slide-show guided presentation of the graduate candidates’ work and accomplishments during the time of their program studies in teacher leadership. For those students who would like to pursue the NJ Teacher Leader Endorsement by matriculating into the COGS in Teacher Leadership program, in addition to the portfolio, this course will also include a clinical self-study with a qualified mentor (a site or district school administrator, or a teacher with a Teacher Leadership Endorsement). To qualify to apply for the NJDOE-approved Teacher Leadership Endorsement, a minimum of 10 hours of clinical practice with a self-selected, approved qualified mentor, resulting in the mastery of the Teacher Leadership Model Standards in the COGS in The Leadership Endorsement Program, is required."
