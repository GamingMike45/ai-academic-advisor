            "Minor in Sports, Society & Civic Leadership This Minor, Sports, Society & Civic Leadership recognizes students’ completion of 18 s.h. in an interdisciplinary program. Students will gain comprehension in analyzing how sport shapes, and is shaped by, cultural understandings of what it means to be human, as well as how sport can serve as a tool for personal and communal identity formation and broader societal impact. Students will find that the program encourages them to be engaged in their communities, to be critical thinkers and leaders in civic engagement through sports, as well as developing their writing and communication skills. This academic background will set students apart for how jobs within a variety of sports fields are looking for holistically trained students in thinking about the field and its impact in society, including but not limited to non-profits, community sports organizations, leagues, communications, public relations, sports management, esports, event planning, social media, psychology, leagues, and more."
