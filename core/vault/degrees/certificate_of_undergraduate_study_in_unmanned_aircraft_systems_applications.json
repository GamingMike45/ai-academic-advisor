            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Applications The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Applications is designed to give students the theoretical knowledge of drone flight and hands-on experience in a fast-growing career field. The Unmanned Aircraft Systems Applications CUGS is not designed to create expert pilots, that will come as students gain more experience; however, the CUGS is designed to train students how to use data collected from Unmanned Aircraft Systems. As such, the classes are not designed for flight instruction as a primary skillset but rather to reinforce data collection and analysis skills."
