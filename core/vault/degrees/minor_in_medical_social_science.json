            "Minor in Medical Social Science There are many health professions other than physician or nurse that require a strong background in medical social science. These include but are not limited to public health, epidemiology, medical research, allied health, community health organizer. At present students interested in the health field can have a pre-med concentration, which relies heavily on math and science. They may take a special program in humanities, which concentrates on ethics. But they do not have an organized way to learn about the social factors influencing health behavior and delivery, gain experience through internships or field placement in health organizations, and explore the vast field of health beyond medical school. This minor offers an opportunity to explore medical social science and provide an experiential component for the student to determine if one of these is the career of interest. It can prepare students for health-related jobs at graduation or for graduate school in public health, urban health, allied health, and the like."
