            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Professional Communication This 12-hour certificate allows students to study theories and techniques of workplace and leadership communication. Using organizational and leadership communication theories, students will critically reflect on practices of workplace and leadership communication, while also learning to communicate complex information to lay audiences within various professional and technical genres, including reports, proposals, instructions, and educational materials. Towards this end, students will gain skills in audience analysis, business presentation, and interviewing strategies, organizational culture analysis, document design, style and editing, and research. Students will become more aware of theories and strategies of oral and written communication through close analysis of organizations and professional and technical exemplary texts."
