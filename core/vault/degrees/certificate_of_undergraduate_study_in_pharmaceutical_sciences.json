In order to apply this course to this CUGS, the topics covered in a taken Advanced Topics course must be related to Pharmaceutical Science and be pre-approved by the CUGS coordinator. To be awarded the CUGS in Pharmaceutical Sciences, students must complete all courses required for the CUGS in Pharmaceutical Science with at least a 2.0 average. All required and optional courses in this CUGS require Organic Chemistry II (CHEM 07201) as a prerequisite. Required course Advanced Biochemistry Lecture requires Biochemistry (CHEM 07348 or BIOL 14348) as a prerequisite. As such, these prerequisites will largely limit this CUGS to those majoring in Biochemistry, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Translational Biomedical Sciences, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Biomedical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering.
