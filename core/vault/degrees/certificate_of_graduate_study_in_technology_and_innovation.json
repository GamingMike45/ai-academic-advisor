            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Technology & Innovation The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Technology & Innovation not only allows students to gain an understanding of the nature of entrepreneurship in various organizational settings, but also why it is essential for today’s entrepreneurs to be familiar with technological topics like e-commerce, web marketing, web safety, and legal issues on the web. Students then apply their entrepreneurial knowledge in a real world setting offering advice to improve business performance and address crucial issues. The Technology & Innovation COGS is a valuable stand-alone credential for those seeking to refresh skills in their current roles. The Technology & Innovation COGS program also serves as a micro-credential on the way toward earning a degree that allows students to sample content before being formally admitted into Rowan’s Master of Business Administration (MBA) with an Entrepreneurship Area of Concentration."
