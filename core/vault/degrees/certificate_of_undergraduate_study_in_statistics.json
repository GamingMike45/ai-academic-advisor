            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Statistics The availability of big data drives a high demand for people to analyze and interpret these data. Statistician is a title sparking interest across all kinds of industries. Jobs in statistics are also growing fast as companies seek to fill more data-driven roles. The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Statistics provides a sequence of courses that introduces students to analyzing data with modern tools and is designed to equip students with the analytical tools and capacities to needed interact with real-world data in a research environment while also accommodating the foundation in the field. Statistics utilizes mathematics, yet it is a distinct discipline in many important dimensions. While both disciplines feature critical thinking and problem solving, statistics requires its own set of analytic tools, and is by nature an interdisciplinary field. This interdisciplinary quality stems from the fact that a significant portion of all applied scientific and business research relies heavily on statistical methods for purposes of inference and modeling through data analysis. Hence, there are a large number of pre-requisite credit hours (6-12) of mathematics and computer science courses. However, students in the targeted majors (STEM or business) are required to take some of the pre-requisite courses for their major, so must only take an additional 0-6 credit hours of pre-requisites outside their respective major. The CUGS in Statistics is only available to students outside the Mathematics Major. The Mathematics majors can either pick the statistics concentration or minor in statistics and operational research."
