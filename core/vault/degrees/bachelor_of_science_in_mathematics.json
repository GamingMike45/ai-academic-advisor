            "Bachelor of Science in Mathematics This major consists of 120 semester hours and requires students to take courses in logic, physics, computer science, and applied and theoretical mathematics. This program is designed to give our mathematics majors the opportunity to prepare more thoroughly for graduate work in mathematics and other disciplines, such as engineering, the physical sciences, statistics, computer science, and other areas requiring extensive mathematical training. The requirements for this degree are also flexible enough so that students intending to seek employment in business, industry, or government can pursue courses of study that will allow them to enter their professions familiar with more of the relevant mathematics. The program is designed to allow students to study the mathematics that they will need with flexibility, breadth, and depth. Majors must pass all required and restricted elective courses needed for graduation with no grade lower than a C-."
