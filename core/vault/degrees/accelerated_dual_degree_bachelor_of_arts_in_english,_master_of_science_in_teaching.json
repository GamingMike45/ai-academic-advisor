            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Arts in English, Master of Science in Teaching The Accelerated Dual Degree program in Subject Matter Education for English, Social Studies, Spanish, and Theatre majors offers the unique opportunity for undergraduate Rowan students who desire to pursue a program of study combining a bachelor’s degree (BA) in their discipline, a Master of Science Degree in Teaching (MST), and an initial New Jersey teacher certification. The ADD Program is offered as a full-time, five-year program. Undergraduate students who qualify for admission into the ADD Program may take up to three graduate courses (9 credit hours) that count toward both their BA degree and their MST degree. ADD students pay undergraduate tuition rates for these graduate courses.  In their final year, students will transition to graduate students and take education courses that lead to New Jersey teacher certification and the Master’s degree.  A full-year (fall-spring semesters) of clinical internship (student teaching) is included in the MST year, as required by the State of New Jersey’s Department of Education.  All subject-specific coursework (English, Social Studies, Spanish, or Theatre) and state-mandated prerequisites must be taken prior to admission into the +1 year. Content Area B.A. Requirements Students must major in English to meet the B.A. requirement of this program. Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts in English can be obtained by contacting the program advisors in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences."
