            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Bilingual Education This program enables students to gain the expertise and instructional certification to become educators in bilingual, P-12 settings. In bilingual classrooms in the US, all students have the same home language background (e.g., Spanish, Mandarin), and the teacher speaks both that language and English as a means of instruction. Bilingual education is currently a critical teaching shortage area both in NJ and across the US. Students in this program must already have an initial teaching license or must be enrolled concurrently in an initial teaching certification program in an area that can be taught in a bilingual setting (e.g., P-3; K-5; Mathematics; Social Studies; Health and PE; Music; Art; Science, etc.)."
