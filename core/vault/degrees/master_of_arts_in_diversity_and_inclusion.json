            "Master of Arts in Diversity & Inclusion The Master of Arts in Diversity & Inclusion offers professionals expertise in understanding and developing long-term solutions to building diverse and inclusive communities. Grounded in ethnographic methodologies and culminating in an applied capstone, our program seeks to help educate transformational participant-leaders who inspire and empower their communities to learn, collaborate, and construct innovative answers. By basing our coursework in the Humanities & Social Sciences, students learn adaptable approaches to strengthen communities in a wide range of environments. The curriculum is designed to offer students a critical approach to understand and evaluate processes that shape and change community life and culture. Moreover, students will have the opportunity to critique and apply custom solutions during their graduate study."
