        "Master of Science in Athletic Training": [
            "Master of Science in Athletic Training The Athletic Training Program at Rowan University is a rigorous and intense program designed to prepare students to take the Board of Certification, Inc., Exam and to become competent Athletic trainers. A major objective of this program is to prepare graduates to enter a variety of employment settings and to render care to a wide spectrum of individuals engaged in physical activity. The technical standards set forth by the Athletic Training Program establish the essential qualities considered necessary for students admitted to this program to achieve the knowledge, skills, and abilities of an entry-level certified athletic trainer, as well as meet the expectations for the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education [CAATE]. Current Rowan University Students The MSAT is essentially a 3+2 Master’s program. Students accepted to Rowan University will declare their major within the undergraduate Pre-Athletic Training (PreAT) curriculum. The PreAT curriculum is designed to prepare students for the Professional Preparation (Graduate) curriculum over a 3 year sequence of courses. In the spring of the junior year, students will apply to the Professional Preparation component. Please see the Undergraduate Catalog under BS in Athletic Training Studies for a description of how the PreAT and the BS in Athletic Training Studies are implemented. Once accepted into the Professional Athletic Training Program, students will begin the curriculum in May of their third year and continue for two calendar years. The MSAT has four (4) total clinical experience classes with two (2) being completely immersive. This means students will spend the majority or all of a semester in the clinical setting without attending face-to-face classes."
