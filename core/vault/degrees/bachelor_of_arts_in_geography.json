            "Bachelor of Arts in Geography The discipline of geography focuses on understanding the world across scales from local to global. It is an integrative science that explores the spatial relationships and functional systems of the natural and human world. The geography major at Rowan maximizes flexibility so that students can design a program of study that meets individual interests and career goals. Geography students complete a common core of 22 s.h. worth of courses and then complete an additional 18+ s.h. of course credit within a specialty area (one of the minors offered in the department)."
