            "Minor in Arabic Studies The Arabic Studies Minor may be declared in the Department of World Languages, Oak Hall 107, or by contacting the University Advising Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 323 (856-256-4459 / advise@rowan.edu). In addition to gaining communicative competence in Arabic, this program allows students to deepen their understanding of Arab culture, society, geography, politics, and history through interdisciplinary coursework. This academic background makes our students more competitive as they search for employment across a wide variety of career fields, including but not limited to work in foreign and public service, international sales and business, humanitarian work, government, politics, and international law. The program consists of 6 courses (18 credits). Students must receive a grade of at least “C-” in all courses for the program. Each of the courses listed below is worth 3 credits. This 18 s.h. minor is open to all students. A placement interview is strongly recommended for students with previous knowledge of Arabic so that they may begin their Arabic language study at the appropriate level. For placement interview information, please contact Mr. Tarek Mousa at mousa@rowan.edu. Students may earn the credits for any skipped courses via the Authorization for Credit by Examination process and these credits are counted in fulfillment of minor requirements. All courses must be passed with a letter grade of “C-” or better and no courses may be taken P/NC. Students may transfer credits into the Arabic Studies Minor, including from study abroad; students planning to study abroad must meet with their Advisor in order to determine course equivalents."
