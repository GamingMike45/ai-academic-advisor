            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences Overview The Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry currently offers a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Biochemistry as well as a Master of Science (MS) in Pharmaceutical Sciences. There are two track available in the Master of Science program (a) Thesis track and (b) Non-Thesis track. The thesis track of the Master of Science program is designed as a research-intensive program and may not be amenable for the accelerated track. The non-thesis track of our Master of Science program is designed for students who intend to further their knowledge in the area of pharmaceutical sciences and hence it would be ideally suited for the creation of an accelerated track. We propose an accelerated program in which high-achieving Rowan Biochemistry majors can obtain the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science (non-thesis track) in a five-year period (rather than the traditional period of six years if both degrees were completed independently). This would create a “3+2” program in which students would be enrolled as undergraduates in the first semester of their fourth year but would enroll as graduate students in the second semester of the 4th year. By beginning graduate-level studies in their fourth year, highly talented and motivated students will be able to complete both degrees on an accelerated timeline. The Bachelor of Science/Master of Science dual degree program will enable students to obtain advanced graduate level training in the pharmaceutical sciences, which will prepare them for careers in industry or further graduate study. The courses required for graduation is a combination of the required courses for the complete core of the Bachelor of Science Biochemistry degree including Rowan general education courses (108 credits) as well as the full 31 credits for the Master of Science Pharmaceutical Sciences (non-thesis track) degree. This intends to use up to 12 credits of the Master of Science courses toward fulfilling the required 120 credits for undergraduate degree completion. The complete program will consist of 139 credits for the dual Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees as opposed to 151 credits if both were done independently."

            "Total credit hours for the Accelerated BS in Biochemistry and MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences: 139 s.h. Requirements for Admission and Graduation Admission Applicants to the accelerated program will submit all application materials by January 15 of the spring semester of their third year at Rowan (nominally “junior” year). The graduate admissions committee in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry will review the applications and students will be notified by February 1. We plan to revisit and potentially fine-tune the details of the admission process two or three years after implementation to take into account the practical aspects that might arise during the first few rounds of applications. Application for admission requires: A minimum overall GPA of 2.8 in undergraduate coursework A complete online Rowan Global application including personal statement A letter of nomination/recommendation from Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry Graduation To graduate from the accelerated Bachelor of Science/Master of Science (non-thesis) dual degree program in Biochemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, students must meet the following requirements: Completion of all program requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry (maintain cumulative GPA of 2.0). Completion of all program requirements for the Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (non-thesis) (maintain cumulative GPA of 3.0 as well as obtain no grade less than B- in any of the graduate courses). Maintain satisfactory progress through the program. Upon completion of the requirements above, the student will be granted both a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and a Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences. Student Status Students enrolled in the accelerated Bachelor of Science/Master of Science Program will pay undergraduate fees the first four years of the program and they will start paying the graduate tuition starting in their fifth year. Students will be allowed to register for 6 s.h. of graduate courses for two semesters in their undergraduate senior year (nominally the fourth year). Students must maintain full time student status during the entire 5-year program. Students will be expected to maintain satisfactory progress through the program. Satisfactory progress will be defined by the following parameters: Earning at least a grade of B- in all the graduate courses. Any student who fails to maintain satisfactory progress as described above will be placed on probation within the program for one semester- if the performance still does not improve, he/she will be dropped from the graduate program. If the student has not already earned the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, he/she will be re-admitted into the Bachelor of Science subject to the requirements of that program. Students with extenuating circumstances may request an exception to this requirement by obtaining written approval of the Program Coordinator of Master of Science Pharmaceutical Sciences as well as their Undergraduate Advisor, and other approvals if needed under University policy. Students who enter the accelerated Master of Science program but do not maintain satisfactory progress or opt-out of the Master of Science degree will be allowed to apply up to 12 credits of Pharmaceutical Sciences coursework credits as restricted or free electives toward the Bachelor of Science Biochemistry degree. If the student opts out before 12 credits have been completed in the Pharmaceutical Sciences program, any remaining credits to make up the required 120 credits for the undergraduate Bachelor of Science Biochemistry degree will be taken using traditional coursework at the Glassboro campus.",
