            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Cybersecurity The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Cyber Security is designed to increase student knowledge in all areas of cyber security including targeted phishing scams, data theft, and other online vulnerabilities. More and more companies actively seek graduates with expertise in cyber security and bemoan the scarcity of graduates with these key skills. This CUGS would be very attractive to many employers looking to keep their companies safe in the new cyber-world. The educational goal of this CUGS is to develop graduates with a technical foundation in cyber security focused on the protection and defense of computer systems. Students will be able to articulate the core concepts of information assurance, asset protection and cyber defense. Also, this CUGS can develop graduates who are able to identify, analyze and remediate security breaches. This CUGS is NOT available to Computer Science majors or Computing & Informatics Majors"
