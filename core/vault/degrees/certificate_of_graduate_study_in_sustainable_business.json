            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Sustainable Business The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Sustainable Business will offer graduate students a credential demonstrating their understanding of applying sustainability concepts in the ‘real world’. The COGS in Sustainability Business, and the courses that comprise the program, are aimed at helping students in diverse graduate disciplines understand avenues for implementing comprehensive sustainability solutions. The Sustainable Business COGS builds on the existing expertise in the Department of Geography, Planning & Sustainability in the School of Earth & Environment at Rowan. While the courses comprising the program are housed in the Department, the program should be attractive from graduate programs in STEM, business, education, social sciences, humanities, and communication arts departments at the University. The courses may be offered online."
