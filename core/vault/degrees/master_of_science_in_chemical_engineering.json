            "Master of Science in Chemical Engineering The Master of Science in Chemical Engineering program emphasizes advanced chemical engineering skills, project management skills, engineering design, and fundamental and applied research, all of which prepares students and working engineers for successful careers in advanced technical fields. This program includes the following focus areas: additive manufacturing; artificial intelligence; bioengineering; bio-based processing; catalysis; crystallization; experimental design and data analysis; machine learning; pharmaceutical engineering; polymers and composites; process design and optimization; reaction engineering; renewable energy; sustainability; and tissue engineering Tracks The program includes two tracks. Each has different course and graduation exit requirements which are outlined below. Thesis Track : The thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours, 6-9 of which are in thesis research/engineering project. Non-Thesis Track : The non-thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours of coursework."
