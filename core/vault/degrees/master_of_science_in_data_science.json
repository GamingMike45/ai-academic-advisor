            "Master of Science in Data Science The Master of Science in Data Science is designed for individuals with a Bachelor’s degree in a STEM related field who are looking to expand their knowledge and opportunities in Data Science. The program has a strong background in Data Mining, Modeling, Statistical and Machine learning. Students will be prepared to use algorithms, statistics, and technology to make informed decisions from massive amounts of data, to manage streamed data or data stored in massive data warehouses, and to visually analyze and present information. Courses are designed to provide expertise in the data sciences and train students to solve problems with complex sets of structured and unstructured data commonly found in any industry. Students may either take a thesis track or non-thesis track. Rowan University undergraduates majoring in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program may apply to the Accelerated Dual Degree (ADD) program which allows them to earn both the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and the Master of Science in Data Science degrees in five years instead of six."
