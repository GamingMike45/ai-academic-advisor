            "Master of Science in Electrical & Computer Engineering The M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering program provides students an opportunity to expand their skill sets in advanced and emerging topics of interest. The program also provides in-depth specialization in several areas, such as signal & image processing, computational intelligence and machine learning, power systems and renewable energy, discrete event systems, and virtual reality systems. Thesis and non-thesis (course-only) options are available, both of which require a total of 30 credits. For the thesis option, 9 of the 30 credits come from original research that culminates in a thesis. For the non-thesis option, all 30 credits come from (ten) courses. If approved by a graduate advisor or department head, 3 credits of the project may be used towards one course requirement. Tracks The program includes two tracks. Each has different course and graduation exit requirements which are outlined below. Thesis Track: The thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours, 6-9 of which are in thesis research/engineering project. Non-Thesis Track: The non-thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours of coursework."
