            "Program Requirements The Rowan University Doctor of Philosophy in Chemical Engineering program requires the completion of coursework, teaching assistantships, research requirements, qualifying and candidacy examinations, dissertation, and dissertation defense. For a student who possesses a bachelor’s degree, a minimum of 72 semester hours of graduate-level coursework will be required. For a student who possesses a master’s degree in a related field, a minimum of 42 semester hours (credits) of graduate-level coursework beyond the master’s degree will be required. Up to 30 of the credits earned in pursuit of the master’s degree may be transferable with advisor approval. Timeline As students will enter the program at many different points, some with a BS in Chemical Engineering, some with an MS in Chemical Engineering, and others with a BS or MS in another related field, it is not practical to provide a common timeline for all incoming students. However, there are some commonalities: Chemical Engineering Core Courses: should be completed by the end of the second year Ethical & Responsible Conduct of Research and Laboratory Safety training must be completed in the first semester, prior to beginning any laboratory work. Chemical Engineering Graduate Seminar - every semester not counting summers PhD Dissertation defense - within 10 semesters not counting summers."
