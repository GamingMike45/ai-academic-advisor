            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Holocaust & Genocide Education The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Holocaust & Genocide Education (HGE) will be the first of its kind nationally. It brings together deep content knowledge with a strong constructivist pedagogy in order to help students consider what Holocaust & Genocide Education might look like across diverse settings. This curriculum could potentially serve both teachers and professionals in public programming of historical topics. This program will fill a much-needed gap in higher education. By helping educators have both a better grasp of Holocaust and genocide content, as well as a mastery of constructivist pedagogies, the COGS in HGE will break new ground. Additionally, this is an essential program, as New Jersey is one of eight states with a Holocaust & Genocide teaching mandate. NJ requires P-12 teachers to teach about the Holocaust and other genocides “at the earliest possible moment.”"
