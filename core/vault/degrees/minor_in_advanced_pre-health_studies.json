                "Minor in Advanced Pre-Health Studies This minor provides mostly mid-level required courses and mid- to upper-level electives related to preparing for health professional school curricula. Only individuals who have completed the prerequisite courses below are eligible and we highly suggest all interested students first meet with an advisor from The Office of Pre-Health Programs before enrolling.  This minor helps develop advanced scientific coursework, however diversifying academic preparation outside of the sciences can be even more well received by professional schools and thus a discussion with a Pre-Health advisor will help in determining the best academic option. The tracks below represent common electives specific to health profession schools including but not limited to medical, dental, podiatry, physical therapy, physician assistant, accelerated  - nursing, optometry, and veterinary programs. To enroll, first schedule a meeting with an advisor from the Office of Pre-Health Programs and your academic advisor to plan your minor coursework. Prerequisites : Students are only eligible if the following courses have been completed or are included in the student’ s major program of study: Two semesters of Biology with lab Two semesters of General Chemistry with lab MATH 01122 - Precalculus Mathematics (or placement exam equivalency) Students must complete a minimum of 23 s.h. from the required and elective courses listed in the appropriate track(s) below - students do not need to complete all electives listed in a track to earn the minor. These tracks are provided for guidance in recommended courses for professional school preparation. Note : Students who have completed the prerequisites through their major or the Minor in Foundations of Biomedical Sciences are eligible for this minor but must select electives so that the minor coursework does not overlap more than 12 s.h. between programs of study."
