            "Master of Arts in Applied Behavior Analysis The mission of the Master of Arts program in Applied Behavior Analysis at Rowan University is to: provide a strong academic foundation in the science of behavior analysis, develop skills necessary to consume current literature and evaluate evidence-based interventions, expose students to high-quality and ethical clinical training experiences in a variety of settings, and foster an appreciation for behavior analysis in both traditional (e.g., home/school, autism, developmental disabilities) and non-traditional settings and populations (e.g., substance use, health behavior). Our program meets the behavior-analytic coursework requirements for those pursuing the BCBA/BCaBA Pathway 2 eligibility route. Applicants will need to meet additional requirements before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination. For more information on becoming a BCBA®, see the Behavior Analyst Certification Board® (BACB®) standards at www.bacb.com."
