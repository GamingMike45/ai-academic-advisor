                "Bachelor of Arts in American Studies The American Studies major is a guided interdisciplinary program that offers students a rigorous and flexible major. The program in American Studies focuses upon concepts of citizenship and is ideal to pair with almost any pre-professional program that deals with the American people. Introduction to American Studies AMST 13301 acquaints students with basic interdisciplinary methodology and provides students with insight into popular culture and citizenship. Students will follow up this course with a rigorous methods course in Interdisciplinary Research and Writing AMST 13301 that prepares students for the upper level coursework. In addition, you will study in the College of Communication and most of the departments in the College of Humanities & Social Sciences addressing issues in American society, culture, history, geography and popular culture. Students will also take an internship course to prepare themselves for their future careers. The program will introduce you to the diversity of peoples who comprise America and to the United States’ relationship to the world. The highlight of every student’s career is the Senior Seminar in American Studies AMST 13402, an intense, discussion-led, capstone experience. The major offers you the flexibility to tailor your program to your personal interests and the time to further explore those courses that interest you or that best apply to your specific career goals by taking courses in several disciplines on American topics. Students are encouraged to specialize by taking several courses from various departments on a similar topic. Except for free electives, no course can be taken as Pass/Fail and all courses must be completed with a C- or better. Students who are not transfers must take a Rowan Seminar."
