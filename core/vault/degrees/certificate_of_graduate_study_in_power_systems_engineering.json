            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Power Systems Engineering The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Power Systems Engineering is designed to provide a breadth and depth to ECE graduate students who want to specialize in Power Systems engineering and prepare them for a career in the power and energy area. A unique aspect of this COGS is that it will develop ECE graduates with a technical foundation in electric power systems focused on the operation of emerging systems. Through this four-class sequence, students will be able to articulate the core concepts of conventional system analysis, different renewable system analysis, electricity market and different smart grid enabling techniques. The completion of this COGS will provide students with the necessary skill sets to start a career in the power and energy industry or pursue more advanced education in power system engineering."
