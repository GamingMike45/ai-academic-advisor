            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Photonics Photonics is a growing industry; demand in areas of optical design, instrumentation design, and application use, and laser-based communication systems is high, and the current workforce is declining. While a generalized physics degree can permit entry-level employment, this Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) provides the training to expand the available opportunities in the field."
