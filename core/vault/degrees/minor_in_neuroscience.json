                "Minor in Neuroscience This minor (M261) is designed for students interested in the study of how the brain and the rest of the nervous system function and the different effects it can have on the body and/or mind. Within this minor, students have the ability to focus primarily on biologically-oriented fields such as molecular, structural, and chemical neuroscience, which focuses on the physical structures and neurotransmitters that the nervous system uses to communicate. Students also have the option to choose a more psychology-oriented direction that covers how the brain and nervous system influence feelings, thoughts, behaviors, and how an organism processes information. Students interested in the Minor in Neuroscience should contact the Program Coordinator in the Fall of their Sophomore year and take PSY 10315 - Physiological Psychology during their sophomore year."
