            "Master of Science in Engineering The Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering general Master of Science in Engineering program at Rowan University effectively prepares individuals to respond to the changing needs of today’s engineers. This program provides students with the necessary knowledge, skill set, and training to effectively contribute to the engineering workforce. Students have access to higher level courses leading to a graduate degree and are involved in professional development opportunities which increase the breadth of understanding and application of engineering principles. The Master of Science in Engineering program allows students an opportunity to expand their skill sets in advanced topics of interest, with content that can span across all engineering disciplines and that is tailored to the student’s specific professional goals. Students can choose between a thesis track and a coursework track. Students may also work on a project, which may be counted toward a coursework track degree. Most full-time students work on funded research projects, leading to a thesis. Most part-time students select the coursework track. In order to be eligible for a Research Assistantship, students must select the thesis track. Tracks The program includes two tracks. Each has different course and graduation exit requirements which are outlined below. Thesis Track: The thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours, 6-9 of which are in thesis research/engineering project. Non-Thesis Track: The non-thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours of coursework. Programs Students in the M.S. program may select from the following areas: Biomedical Engineering Chemical Engineering Civil & Environmental Engineering Electrical & Computer Engineering Materials Science & Engineering Mechanical Engineering Note: Students may also choose to pursue a tailored Master of Science in Engineering program under the direction of a faculty advisor."
