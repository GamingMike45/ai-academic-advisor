            "Master of Science in Civil & Environmental Engineering The Master of Science in Civil & Environmental Engineering program at Rowan University effectively prepares individuals to respond to the changing needs of today’s engineers. This program provides students with the necessary knowledge, skill set, and training to effectively contribute to the engineering workforce. Students have access to higher level courses leading to a graduate degree and are involved in professional development opportunities which increase the breadth of understanding and application of engineering principles. The Civil & Environmental Engineering program allows students to develop an interdisciplinary focus through their coursework and thesis topic. Graduate students work with faculty with expertise in transportation, geo-technology, structures, water resources, and the environment. Interdisciplinary areas include mechanics and materials, and sustainability. This program also includes the following focus areas: Mechanics and Materials; Sustainability; and Transportation Engineering. Students can choose between a thesis track and a coursework track. Students may also work on a project, which may be counted toward a coursework track degree. Most full-time students work on funded research projects, leading to a thesis. Most part-time students select the coursework track. In order to be eligible for a Research Assistantship, students must select the thesis track. Tracks The program includes two tracks. Each has different course and graduation exit requirements which are outlined below. Thesis Track: The thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours, 6-9 of which are in thesis research/engineering project. Non-Thesis Track: The non-thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours of coursework."
