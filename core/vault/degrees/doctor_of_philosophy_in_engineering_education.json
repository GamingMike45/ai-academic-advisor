            "Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Education The Ph.D. in Engineering Education program is a terminal degree program that is designed to meet the changing needs of researchers, scholars, and scientists in academia, industry, and the government with an interest in engineering education. The primary goal of this program is therefore to prepare students for careers in research and/or academics by providing an environment that closely reflects the realities and expectations encountered by today’s academicians, professional scientists, and research engineers. The program offers a highly flexible inter and multidisciplinary curricular structure, allowing specialization in any (or multiple) of the traditional or emerging areas of Engineering Education. Graduates emerge with a strong foundation in research methodologies, technical expertise, and the ability to apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios, making them valuable assets to academic institutions, industry organizations, and government agencies. The Ph.D. in Engineering Education has the following program goals: Candidates will obtain a solid foundation of engineering education research methods and apply these methods to addressing research questions relevant to real-world engineering problems Students will learn the skills of oral technical communications and effective teaching for disseminating and imparting knowledge both in academic and non-academic settings Students will learn the skills of professional writing for disseminating engineering education knowledge, and preparing effective grant applications for seeking external funding from a variety of sponsors that fund Engineering Education Research Students will learn how to identify unsolved problems in engineering education, formulate research questions, create a study using appropriate education research methods, analyze results and draw conclusions"

        "Program Requirements": [
            "Program Requirements The Rowan University Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Education program requires the completion of coursework, research requirements, dissertation, and dissertation defense. For a student who possesses a bachelor’s degree, a minimum of 72 semester hours of graduate-level coursework will be required. For a student who possesses a master’s degree in a related field, a minimum of 42 semester hours (credits) of graduate-level coursework beyond the master’s degree will be required. Up to 30 of the credits earned in pursuit of the master’s degree may be transferable. Students who do not possess a master’s degree in engineering are required to complete 30 semester hours of engineering disciplinary graduate level coursework. As part of meeting this requirement, students are strongly encouraged to complete a disciplinary MS degree in one of the other engineering departments at Rowan"
