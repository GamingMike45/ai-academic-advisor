            "Master of Arts in Equity, Access & Success in Education The objective of Rowan University’s Master of Arts (M.A.) in Equity, Access, & Success in Education is to prepare urban educators, community organizers, policymakers, school leaders, and youth-focused change agents to understand the contradictions of current school systems and meaningfully address the educational and broader socioeconomic disparities that many communities too often face. The program meets its primary objective through a focus on students understanding and applying a range of critical perspectives to study urban education and communities including from historical, legal, sociological, and political economic lenses. There are no certifications attached to the program. The program culminates in a master’s degree."
