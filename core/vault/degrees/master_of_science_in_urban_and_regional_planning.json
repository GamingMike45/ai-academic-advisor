            "Master of Science in Urban & Regional Planning As we move to an era of decreased reliance on fossil fuels and rapidly diminished available land for development, efficiency in the use of the remaining land and in the sustainability of every dimension of our lifestyles will become ever more critical. Wise planning will become increasingly necessary. Planners are in demand to fill positions in consulting, industry, government, and non-profit organizations. A master’s degree in Urban & Regional Planning is recognized as the terminal degree for this profession. This program focuses on all planning fields commonly practiced in southern New Jersey but at the same time highlights their global significance related to climate change, environmental degradation, sustainability, resiliency, and diversity. This program accommodates the needs of full-time professionals through a combination of evening and online courses. The program accepts students with undergraduate degrees from both science and liberal arts backgrounds. Graduates are qualified to work within government, private, or nonprofit sectors. Students interested in advanced studies will have the opportunity to work on research projects under the supervision of faculty members. The M.S. in Urban & Regional Planning is a full-time or part-time program offered in a face-to-face format with some online options. It requires the completion of 46 graduate semester hours (14 courses)."
