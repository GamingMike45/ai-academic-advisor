            "Minor in Human Resource Management The goal of the minor program is to provide non-Business majors with the opportunity to qualify for entry-level human resource management positions. The objective of the program is to understand the legal and regulatory environment of human resource management, to develop the capability of using state-of-the-art hiring and recruiting techniques, and to learn how to harmonize an organization’s compensation systems with its strategic goals. The program is based on the required human resource management coursework of the major in human resource management except that it has fewer required courses and fewer elective courses."
