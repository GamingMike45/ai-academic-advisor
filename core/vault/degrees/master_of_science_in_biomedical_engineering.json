            "Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering The Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering program at Rowan University effectively prepares individuals to respond to the changing needs of engineers today. This program provides students with the necessary knowledge, skill set, and training to effectively contribute to the engineering workforce. Students have access to higher level courses leading to a graduate degree and are involved in professional development opportunities which increase the breadth of understanding and application of engineering principles. The Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering is a research-based degree, and additional graduate-level Biomedical Engineering coursework gives students an opportunity to expand their skill set in advanced topics of interest. Advanced topics include Biomaterials Engineering, Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, Bioinstrumentation, Biomechanics and Mechanobiology, Immunoengineering and other emerging areas. A novel research project completed under the mentorship of a faculty advisor and culminating in a Thesis, requires students to effectively apply engineering principles to solve a contemporary biomedical problem."
