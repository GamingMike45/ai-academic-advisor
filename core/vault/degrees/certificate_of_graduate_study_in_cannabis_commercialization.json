            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Cannabis Commercialization The rapidly evolving cannabis industry is anticipated to become a multi-billion dollar economic driver across the USA - and beyond. Career opportunities related to cannabis are vast, and cross-over talent is in high demand. Plant-touching verticals such as cultivation, extraction, manufacturing and/or retail need experts from other industries to adapt, extend, and expand best practices into the highly regulated cannabis market. There is strong and growing demand for ancillary businesses complementing and serving the cannabis industry, with potential career pathways in far ranging categories such as accessory manufacturers, tech start-ups, as well as services and solutions in accounting and tax, finance and banking, data analysis, marketing and branding, supply chain, and healthcare. Whether you are drawn to Plant Touching or Ancillary Cannabis Business career pathways - or want to explore options in both categories - you can tailor the Cannabis Commercialization COGS to support your career goals."
