            "Bachelor of Science in Biophysics The Bachelor of Science Program in Biophysics prepares students for medical school, graduate school in biophysics, and careers in the biomedical industry. While more specialized than the Bachelor of Science in Physics, there is still enough broad scientific learning such that the degree can also lead to similar post-graduate paths. Students may wish to pursue an Accelerated Dual Degree Program with the Masters of Science in Cell & Molecular Biology, Doctor of Medicine, or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. Many opportunities exist for student/faculty collaborative research. These experiential activities amplify student development and are strongly encouraged."
