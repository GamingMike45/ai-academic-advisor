            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Sustainability Studies The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Sustainability Studies offers students a credential demonstrating their understanding of applying sustainability concepts in the ‘real world’. Research in STEM fields has resulted in amazing advances in our societal ability to generate solutions to environmental challenges, but there is frequently a disconnect between the solutions and their implementation. The COGS in Sustainability Studies, and the courses that comprise the program, are aimed at helping STEM students understand avenues for implementing comprehensive sustainability solutions. Similarly, the University lacks a pathway for students pursuing graduate degrees in business, education, social sciences, humanities, or communication arts to include coursework on sustainability and environmental issues as a part of their education. The COGS in Sustainability Studies is also a useful avenue for these non-STEM students to strengthen their environment and sustainability skill set."
