Students whose undergraduate degree is in another content area (e.g., English, Social Studies, Spanish, French, etc.) may need to take as many as 30 additional credits in theater to meet certification requirements before being accepted into the program. Questions about appropriate undergraduate majors, academic sequences, or prerequisites should be directed to the program coordinator. The program can be completed in 12-24 months"
