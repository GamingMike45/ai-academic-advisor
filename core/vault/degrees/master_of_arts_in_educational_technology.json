Individuals completing this online program will not only be skilled in the use of technology resources in the classroom, they will be prepared to assume leadership roles in educational technology in preschool to twelfth grades. Through intensive seven-week* online courses, graduate level students will be able to complete the program in two years. This graduate program is intended for educators and educational leaders who place a high value on successful teaching and learning through the use of educational technology. The purpose of the program is to help teacher leaders and administrators reflect on educational technology best practices and discover ways to expertly infuse technology into teaching so as to improve student learning and engagement. Additionally, students in the program will investigate the philosophical, psychological, sociological, and educational implications of emerging technology tools and their impact on schools. Current relationships between theory and practice, along with future technologies, will be examined. Teachers in the state of New Jersey may apply to the Master of Arts in Educational Technology program through the New Jersey Teacher Outreach Program (NJTOP®)."
