            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Disaster Social Services & Continuum of Care The Disaster Social Services and Continuum of Care COGS is designed to facilitate rapid entry into the disaster response and services coordination, including emergency housing, long-term temporary sheltering, coordination of health, economic, and behavioral health services among survivors of disasters and crises. Working in conjunction with emergency response partners and human services providers (government and non-governmental organizations), Disaster Social Services and Continuum of Care professionals seek to improve coordination with programs and resources in the wake of a disaster or crisis in communities to improve community resilience. “The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recognizes that social workers play a critical role in supporting recovery efforts and restoring health systems and social service networks to promote the resilience and well-being of impacted communities and individuals. Disaster social work is concerned with the intervention in the social and physical environments of individuals and groups as a means of preventing serious long-term emotional, spiritual, and mental health problems after a disaster (Rogge, 2003). Through these central functions, social workers are valuable at every stage of a natural disaster. Social workers intervene before, during, and after a disaster to ensure that individuals, families, and communities prepare effectively for a potential disaster, endure the hardship of a disaster event, and receive the support they need to begin rebuilding their lives. Disaster social work is concerned with the intervention in the social and physical environments of individuals and groups as a means of preventing serious long-term emotional, spiritual, and mental health problems after a disaster (Rogge, 2003).” Excerpt from The National Association of Social Workers: https://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Zn4O2yvFI4%3D&portalid=0#:~:text=mental%20health%20problems%20after%20a,disaster%20(Rogge%2C%202003).
