            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Advanced Engineering Materials The CUGS in Advanced Engineering Materials will allow students to increase the depth and breadth of knowledge in materials for engineering, especially mechanical engineering, applications. The CUGS will offer students an opportunity to learn critical material properties, processes, characterization, and applications in engineering materials. It will allow students to learn in-depth knowledge of a wide variety of materials such as composites, nanomaterials, energy materials, and the latest materials used in additive manufacturing. This CUGS will allow students to take additional specialized coursework related to the field of Advanced Engineering Materials beyond the 120 credits mandated by the undergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering."
