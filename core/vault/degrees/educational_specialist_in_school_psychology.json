            "Educational Specialist in School Psychology The Educational Specialist is an advanced degree that enables the candidate to develop practitioner expertise in psychological, educational, professional and related areas. Candidates hone skills in assessment, consultation, counseling and intervention to prepare to work with children and adolescents, parents, guardians, teacher and other educational professionals in a school setting. To earn the Educational Specialist degree, a candidate must complete all courses, a school-based 300 hour practicum, and a school-based 1200-hour externship/internship. Upon completion of the Educational Specialist degree, candidates are eligible for New Jersey Department of Education certification as a school psychologist. Rowan University Educational Specialist graduates may also apply to become a Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP).
