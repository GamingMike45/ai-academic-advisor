            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Paleontology Foundations The Certificate in Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Paleontology Foundations offers an introduction to Earth history and evolution from the wide array of paleontology courses taught by full-time faculty paleontologists from the Department of Geology. Our program balances practical skills with current theory while emphasizing the importance of field research. Students are immersed in popular science, debates, and new research frontiers. Current and future citizen scientists, geoscience educators and researchers, and career paleontologists will gain a solid foundation in paleontology. Students can explore their passion for paleontology, the Earth, and deep time as preserved in the rock record within our unique program and wide range of course offerings. The range of offerings and options offers flexibility to ensure this CUGS is interesting and useful to students from diverse backgrounds and with varied career goals. This CUGS is open to any matriculated or non-matriculated student with an interest in paleontology from any degree program, including Geology."
