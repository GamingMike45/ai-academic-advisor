            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, Master of Arts in Mathematics The accelerated dual Bachelor of Science/Master of Arts in Mathematics program provides an opportunity for individuals to pursue advanced study in mathematics and to develop skills that can lead to success in today’s technologically oriented society. Whether the goal involves applying mathematics to solve problems in business and industry, teaching in higher education or preparing for further graduate study in mathematics or related fields, this program enables each student to pursue a course of study that is appropriate for his or her interests. The dual degree program is designed to be completed in five years.  Students will begin the first (freshman) year of the program through the third (junior) year fulfilling undergraduate B.S. in Mathematics course requirements and general education course requirements.  The fourth (senior) year marks the official start of the dual degree program.  In year four students will begin to take some graduate level courses and will complete any remaining undergraduate B.S. in Mathematics and general education course requirements.  Year five includes the remaining credits of M.A. in Mathematics courses to be taken as a graduate student."

Twelve semester hours will provide a core experience for all graduate students, including one course in linear algebra, one course in abstract algebra, and two courses in analysis.  Students will also complete 3-9 s.h. from Bank A, 6-12 s.h. from Bank B, and a minimum of 3 s.h. in Seminar and Research. Students should enroll in the required core courses first. The Mathematics Seminar is required and should be taken after most of the course work is completed. The comprehensive exam is usually taken during the Mathematics Seminar."
