            "Bachelor of Arts in Geology The Bachelor of Arts in Geology is a physical science major composed of foundation courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics; core courses in geology; and electives in geology or related disciplines. The elective course choices in this program make it easier to pursue related minors or concentrations. The program is designed to prepare students to immediately enter positions in the geoscience workforce in consulting firms or government agencies; pursue professional studies; or undertake graduate studies."
