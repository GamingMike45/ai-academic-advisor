            "Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling The focus of the Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling program is on preparing students to become mental health counselors who are involved in the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of mental health problems. Many of our students apply for licensure as Licensed Associate Counselors (LAC), and then as Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC) in New Jersey and other states. With the master’s degree completion, some students choose to seek research positions or pursue doctoral degrees. As such, students will receive a comprehensive background in counseling theories, empirical research findings, counseling skills, and treatment approaches necessary for the effective delivery of services in a variety of mental health settings. The program places a particular emphasis upon delivering strong skills in differential diagnosis, conceptualization, and the use of evidence-based practices, with strong studies in ethics and multicultural issues. As part of their program, students are required to complete at least 600 hours of supervised practice in a mental health setting and complete the Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE). The master’s program consists of 60 credit hours of graduate work, which is the educational requirement for the LAC/LPC. Students may also become involved in faculty labs, on a volunteer basis. This is valuable in gaining research experience and in further connecting with faculty."
