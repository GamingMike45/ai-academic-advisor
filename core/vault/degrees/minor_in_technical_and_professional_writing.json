            "Minor in Technical & Professional Writing This 18-hour minor allows students to study techniques and strategies used in genres of technical and professional writing, including within technical, medical, scientific, nonprofit, and other professional contexts. Students will learn to write in various professional and technical genres, such as reports, proposals, instructions, and educational materials, and will learn to compose for a variety of audiences. A particular focus of the minor will be in learning to communicate complex information to lay audiences. Towards this end, students will gain skills in audience analysis, document design, style and editing, and research. Students will become more aware of theories and strategies of writing through close rhetorical analysis of professional and technical exemplary texts."
