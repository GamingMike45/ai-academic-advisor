            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Marine Sciences The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Marine Sciences introduces students to the interdisciplinary study of the ocean. Marine sciences integrates the physical, chemical, geological, and biological features and processes of oceans. Students completing this program will gain a foundational understanding of ocean systems and the tools used to collect samples and data in oceans. The CUGS in Marine Sciences ties together and builds upon existing course offerings across the departments of Biology, Environmental Science, and Geology to create a comprehensive program of study that introduces undergraduate students to the study of marine science. The CUGS in Marine Sciences is intended to serve undergraduate students in STEM disciplines from both academic units including, for example, environmental science, geology, and biological sciences."
