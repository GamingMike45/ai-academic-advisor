            "Graduate Endorsement in Bilingual/Bicultural Education This program responds to the need for highly qualified teachers prepared to teach content in both the students’ native language and in English to the growing number of Multilingual Learners in schools. The program, approved by the New Jersey State Department of Education, includes 12 credits hours of formal instruction in the following topics: linguistics, language acquisition, development of literacy skills for the second (or additional) language learner, methods of teaching content in bilingual education, and theory and practice of bilingual education. Specific objectives emphasize the application of theory to practice, the development of long-range and short-range plans that integrate language and content, the design of appropriate authentic assessment instruments, and the use of technology to research content and instructional techniques."
