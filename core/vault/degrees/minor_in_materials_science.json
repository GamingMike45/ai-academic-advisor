                "Minor in Materials Science The Minor in Materials Science is available to several majors at Rowan and is recommended for Physics majors intending to attend graduate school in a materials-related field or expecting to directly enter the workforce. A student seeking this minor must elect to take INTR 01486 - Interdisciplinary Materials Science  and two additional materials-related courses outside their major. (Abbreviated lists for BS Physics majors are provided below. Many other courses contain a materials science component and can be selected with the help of your advisor.)"
