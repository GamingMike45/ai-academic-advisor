            "Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics This major consists of 120 semester hours and requires students to take courses in logic, physics, computer science, statistics, and applied and theoretical mathematics. Students in consultation with faculty advisors can construct flexible programs using the three concentrations: comprehensive, education, and statistics. This program prepares students to find careers in business, industry, government, or education in positions such as researchers, actuaries, statisticians, analysts, or teachers. Three years of high school mathematics are required for admission; a fourth year of mathematics and at least one programming course is highly recommended. Advanced placement credit is accepted; waivers are available. Majors must pass all required and restricted elective courses needed for graduation with no grade lower than a C-."
