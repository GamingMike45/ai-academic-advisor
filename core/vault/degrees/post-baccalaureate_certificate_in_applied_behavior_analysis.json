            "Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Applied Behavior Analysis Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) involves the use of well-established and empirically supported principles to address behavioral concerns and facilitate skill acquisition. ABA has been empirically shown to be effective in a wide variety of areas and has received the most recognition for its success in designing and providing behavioral support for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disabilities. Our program meets the behavior-analytic coursework requirements for those pursuing the BCaBA Pathway 2 eligibility route. In addition to coursework, the BCaBA certification requires a bachelor’s degree from an accredited university, and additional hours of supervised practice. For more information, please see Behavior Analyst Board Certification, Inc. standards at www.bacb.com. A note about BCaBA Certification While the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) has approved the courses in the Post-Baccalaureate in Applied Behavior Analysis as meeting the coursework requirements for the Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst (BCaBA) certification, applicants will have to meet additional requirements to qualify for the BCaBA certification including: Bachelor’s degree from an accredited university Additional hours of supervised fieldwork The Behavior Analyst Certification Board has ultimate responsibility for determining eligibility for certification as a BCaBA."
