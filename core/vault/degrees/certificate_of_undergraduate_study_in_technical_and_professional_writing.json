A particular focus of the certificate will be in learning to communicate complex information to lay audiences. Towards this end, students will gain skills in audience analysis, document design, style and editing, and research. Students will become more aware of theories and strategies of writing through close rhetorical analysis of professional and technical exemplary texts."
