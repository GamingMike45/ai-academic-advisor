            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Physics, Master of Science in Materials Science & Engineering This accelerated dual-degree program offers students the opportunity to earn a B.S. in Physics and an M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering in five years. Students MUST apply 2 years before the anticipated completion of the combined BS/MS program.  For example, students on the standard curriculum path (beginning Fall Semester of a student’s first year) seeking to complete the BS/MS program by May of the fifth year would apply during the Spring semester of the third year, according to the regular graduate admissions schedule for the subsequent Fall semester.  The 12 graduate credits will be applied towards both the undergraduate and graduate programs, i.e., students only need to earn a total of 138 credits. The MSE graduate courses all count as Restricted Electives in the BS Physics program."

                "Total Required Credits for the Entire Accelerated Dual Degree: 138 s.h. Requirements for Admission: Successful applicants to the Accelerated Dual Degree MUST meet the following admissions requirements: Completed ADD Agreement & Confirmation form, maintained/administered by the Registrar: https://sites.rowan.edu/registrar/cadp/ Completed ADD Physics-MSE Application form, maintained/administered by the Department of Physics A minimum undergraduate cumulative GPA of 3.2 or better on a 4.0 scale. Completion of 75 total credits of the standard BS Physics curriculum. Grade of C+ or better of the following undergraduate-level courses (or their equivalent): Introductory Mechanics (PHYS 00220); Introductory Thermodynamics, Fluids, Waves and Optics (PHYS 00221); Introductory Electricity & Magnetism (PHYS 00222); Modern Physics (PHYS 00300), Calculus I (MATH 01130), Calculus II (MATH 01131 ), and Calculus III (MATH 01230). Decisions will be made by the graduate program chair in consultation with the department chair. To take the graduate courses and transition to the MS in Materials Science & Engineering (G947) portion, students will complete the standard MS application. Applicants must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 and at least 2 supportive letters of recommendation. Those not admitted will remain in the standard BS Physics (1902) program.  Those who are admitted but do not complete the MS will still receive credit for 12 graduate courses taken as restricted electives in the BS Physics (1902) program. Requirements for Graduation : To graduate with the dual BS/MS degrees in Physics (1902) and MSE (G947), students must satisfy the full degree requirements for the BS in Physics (1902) and MS in MSE (G947) Programs.  The accelerated BS/MS program allows eligible students accepted into the program to take up to 12 graduate credits during their senior year. Twelve of these credits can be counted to satisfy the degree requirements of both the BS and the MS programs. The remaining graduate credits can only be applied to the MS program. In summary, these full degree requirements entail the requirements of The existing 120-credit BS-Physics (1902) curriculum The existing 30-credit MS-MSE (G947) curriculum A minimum of 138 total credits for completion of the ADD (with 12 credits double-counted) Specific requirements for the graduate level coursework include satisfaction of Category 2 Minimum Satisfactory Academic Progress status as defined by Rowan Global: Graduate coursework letter grades must be no lower than “B-“ Cumulative graduate coursework GPA must remain at 3.0 or higher (on a 4.0) scale For the MS Materials Science & Engineering (G947) portions, students will graduate with the MS degree upon completion of 30 credits as per the program requirements. Thesis-track students will also be required to successfully complete a thesis defense. All students will require a minimum cumulative graduate GPA of 3.0 and minimum grades of B- in all graduate courses. Students in the ADD will thus only have to complete [120+30-12] 138 total credits for both degrees. Student Status: Students must maintain an overall (undergraduate + graduate) cumulative GPA of 3.0 in each semester they are enrolled in the ADD.  In addition, complete all requirements of the BS Physics (1902) degree before they begin the final year of the ADD. Students are expected to maintain full-time enrollment status (at least 9 graduate-level credits per semester) in the final two semesters of the ADD. Students who enter the ADD but do not maintain satisfactory academic progress or who simply choose not to continue pursuing the MS degree will be allowed to formally “opt out” back to the BS Physics (1902) program.  No more than 12 credits of graduate-level technical elective coursework may be applied to BS Physics (1902) requirements; however, students remain fully vested in their graduate coursework, which may be applied toward a future Rowan MS-MSE (G947) degree, subject to (re)admission and transcript (re)evaluation.  Such coursework may also be transferable to other institutions; however, transferability is a prerogative beyond Rowan’s control. For students entering the ADD program on the standard BS Physics (1902) curriculum path, all BS degree requirements should be fulfilled by the 4th year of study, so the opt-out action will not result in a delayed BS degree conferral of more than one semester beyond that in which the “opt-out” action was taken (due to Registrar’s typical administrative timeline). Contingency for Students who do not Complete the M.S. program: Students who are dropped from the graduate program or choose not to complete the B.S./M.S. program will earn a B.S. in Physics once they have completed all requirements for that undergraduate degree, achieved at least a 2.0 GPA, and earned at least 120 credits. Students may count up to 12 credits of their graduate courses toward their B.S. requirements; these courses will also count as restricted electives toward the 120 credits required for a B.S. degree.",
