            "Bachelor of Arts in Writing Arts The Writing Arts major provides broad-based study and practice in written communication, drawing on the disciplinary strengths of the Ric Edelman College of Communication, Humanities & Social Sciences, and from departments across the University. Writing Arts offers students intensive experience in a variety of writing forms, creative and expository, personal and public. Students learn how writers compose in print and new media forms and how audiences respond to their writing. In classroom workshops and peer response groups, through interactive lecture and discussion, and by creating and composing multiple drafts and revisions, students develop sensitivity to rhetorical considerations of audience, purpose, and genre. Through these diverse experiences, students are prepared for success in a wide variety of settings beyond the University."
