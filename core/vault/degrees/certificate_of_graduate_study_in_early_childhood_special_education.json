            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Early Childhood Special Education The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Early Childhood Special Education is designed for education professionals to enhance their knowledge and skills in early childhood special education, expand their employment opportunities, and increase services to young children with disabilities and their families. The program is ideal for early intervention therapists and instructors, professionals with diverse backgrounds who currently work in early childhood special education settings, and family members who may want additional expertise or training in this area of study. Students are prepared to support infants and toddlers in home-based and/or center-based Early Intervention, preschoolers (3-5) in preschool special education, and children with suspected but not yet diagnosed delays or disabilities across various birth- five (5) settings. This program will not lead to certification*. Teachers in the state of New Jersey may apply to the Certificate of Graduate Study in Early Childhood Special Education program through the New Jersey Teacher Outreach Program (NJTOP®). * All courses in this COGS may be applied as an approved track/specialization within the MA in Special Education (note: separate eligibility and application process for the MA will apply)."

Foundation Courses None Graduation/Exit, Benchmark, and/or Thesis Requirements ECSE 10504: Self Study Project Inquiry in Early Childhood Special Education This course provides a culminating capstone experience for graduate students enrolled in the Early Childhood Special Education Certificate of Graduate Study (ECSE COGS). Students will work closely with a faculty member to self-select a timely area of inquiry in the ECSE field that directly or indirectly impacts inter-disciplinary professionals, families, and/or young children with suspected or diagnosed disabilities across diverse birth-five settings. This self-study will result in the production of a literature review, a service project/outreach initiative, and formal information-sharing/presentation with relevant stakeholders. Students will incorporate one or more theoretical frameworks and content from each of the ECSE COGS courses and will be evaluated on rubrics that assess both content and quality. Students must maintain a “B” average across all ECSE COGS coursework and high ratings on devised disposition checklists from supervising site director and/or lead teacher during each course where field assignments are completed. Minimum Required Grades and Cumulative GPA The Certificate of Graduate Study in Early Childhood Special Education is a Category 2 program.
