            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Qualitative Research The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Qualitative Research is an interdisciplinary program primarily designed to prepare students to learn how to collect, analyze, and present qualitative data from a variety of sources including individual interviews, focus groups, participatory and ethnographic research. Qualitative research is increasingly used in a wide range of fields for the purpose of developing health and social policies, public relations strategies, consumer products, computer programs, educational programs, and governmental policies. The CUGS in Qualitative Research brings together courses from a variety of fields including sociology and anthropology, history, public relations, marketing, and radio, television and film. This CUGS will enhance opportunities for students from the various colleges to integrate knowledge and methods from a variety of disciplines, and thus, will allow students to create an integrative and innovative curriculum. A CUGS in Qualitative Research that engages students in experiential learning will enhance job accessibility and work performance."
