            "Minor in International Studies The International Studies minor is an interdisciplinary program that helps prepare students for careers in an increasingly interdependent world. Students are introduced to a wide range of economic, political, and environmental issues, and they develop expertise in the culture, history, and languages of other parts of the world. International Studies may be pursued in conjunction with major and minor programs. Global/Comparative courses (6 credits) and Elective courses (6 credits) must come from at least two different departments. At least two courses in these categories (Global/Comparative AND Elective, together) must be upper-level (300/400 level) courses. All International Studies minors must complete a second-semester or higher World Language (or CLEP equivalent), e.g., Spanish II. The first semester of the language does NOT count toward the minor. Any additional world language courses in this language (at a higher level) or another language (at any level) may fill elective requirements. Students who complete an approved Study Abroad program will have their 300/400 level elective requirement reduced by one course, i.e., studying abroad counts as one of the upper-level courses required for the minor. Students may also count towards the minor any specific courses related to International Studies taken abroad, provided that they are approved by the home department and the University."
