            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Diversity & Inclusion The Certificate in Graduate Study (COGS) in Diversity & Inclusion will educate professionals who can help create diverse workspaces where innovation can thrive when people are able to work, volunteer, and govern because of their differences. Rooted in ethnographic methodology, the program will provide students with knowledge and methodologies to help specific organizations or institutions work towards building diverse and inclusive communities. This work requires deep knowledge of cultures, history, ideas, social structures, institutions, and politics, which are concepts the College of Humanities & Social Sciences (CHSS) has been exploring for generations."
