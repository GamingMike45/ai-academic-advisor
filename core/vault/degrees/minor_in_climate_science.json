            "Minor in Climate Science The Joint Environmental Science/Geology Minor in Climate Science offers students the opportunity to gain important insights into the extremely interdisciplinary realm of climate science from both environmental and geological perspectives. This minor is offered by the faculty of the Environmental Science and Geology programs and is designed to serve any matriculated student, though, due to the nature of the courses and the fact that some require basic science and math pre-requisites, it may be most suitable for students who are currently pursuing science degrees. It is likely that this program would be especially well-suited to Environmental Science, Geology, Biology, Physics, Engineering, and/or Math students. The Climate Science minor stipulates a minimum of 19 semester credit hours of courses that provide a fundamental grounding in the science of anthropogenic climate change. These courses include introductory classes that cover the basics of climate change, and courses that emphasize climate impacts on the ocean and atmosphere. Elective courses (at least one each from Environmental Science and Geology) assure students an opportunity to study individual impacts of climate change in greater depth."
