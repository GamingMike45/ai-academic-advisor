            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Public History Public History is usually defined as history beyond the walls of a traditional classroom. Public Historians work as preservationists in archives and research libraries and as museum professionals. They may be curators, museum educators, exhibit producers, oral historians, and even community activists. The CUGS in Public History will interest students who hope to work in historical, natural history, or anthropological museums; historical societies; federal, state and local government; archival management; etc. The Certificate requires 15 s.h. of courses related to public history, including three core courses and two electives."
