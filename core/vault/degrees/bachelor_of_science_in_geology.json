            "Bachelor of Science in Geology The Bachelor of Science in Geology is a physical science major composed of foundation courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics; core courses in geology; and electives in geology, applied geology, or paleontology. The program is designed to prepare students to immediately enter positions in the geoscience workforce in consulting firms or government agencies; pursue professional studies; or undertake graduate studies in geoscience disciplines. The curriculum is designed around the diverse expertise of our faculty. As such, nearly all of our courses are taught by full-time members of the department including professors actively conducting research. This provides our students with hands-on experience from experts in techniques, scientific methodologies, and critical thinking. The expertise of our faculty instills into our students the necessary, diverse perspectives along with a wide knowledge base of many sub-disciplines of geology to successfully continue on to careers that solve the integrated issues facing our state, country, and planet."
