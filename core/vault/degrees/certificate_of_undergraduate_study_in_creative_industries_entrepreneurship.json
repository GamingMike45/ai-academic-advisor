            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Creative Industries Entrepreneurship The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Creative Industries Entrepreneurship is designed to foster the combination of creative pursuits with entrepreneurial thinking and business know-how. As demonstrated by the thousands of students who have used Studio231 on campus to rapid prototype their ideas and explore how those could be made into products, and the launch of Creatives 230, there is a high interest among Rowan’s creative industries students (e.g., music, art, writing arts, theater, etc.) for more formalized training and micro-credentials where they can acquire entrepreneurial skills to leverage as they graduate and enter the workforce. Many creatives seek to avoid the ‘starving artist’ stigma, so this program seeks to offer students a hybrid-option where they can develop both entrepreneurial and creative skillsets and mindsets in just 4 courses (12 s.h.)."
