            "Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience The Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience prepares students in an interdisciplinary field studying the nervous system and how it controls physiological functions such as behavior and cognition. Students will learn the subdisciplines of neurobiology, neuropsychology, and theoretical and computational neuroscience. Students will develop conceptual and hands-on training to apply their knowledge to careers in the field or continued graduate or professional studies."
