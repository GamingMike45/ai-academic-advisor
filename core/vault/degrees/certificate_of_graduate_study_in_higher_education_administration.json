            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Higher Education Administration The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Higher Education Administration seeks to provide a high-quality series of courses which prepares individuals for administrative and student affairs roles in institutions of higher education, including 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities. Students are to develop knowledge, skills, and dispositions associated with the organization, administration, and governance, implementing student service programs, providing for traditional and non-traditional students, promoting change, and understanding emergent issues in higher education. This COGS may be applied toward graduate degree completion (such as the M.A. in Higher Education), but that coursework does not necessarily need to fulfill any specific degree requirements."
