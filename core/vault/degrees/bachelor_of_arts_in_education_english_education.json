            "Bachelor of Arts in Education: English Education Faculty in the Bachelor of Arts in English Education strive to transcend traditional rote forms of learning and model a more collaborative, interactive, and intellectually challenging pedagogy that is true to the richness and rigor of the academic disciplines they represent. As teacher candidates experience and participate in such learning environments in their education classes at Rowan, they develop the commitment, confidence, and ability to go into the field and create P-12 classroom environments in which students work actively with the teacher and with each other to investigate important and meaningful ideas in a particular academic discipline. Admission to Rowan University does not guarantee admission to the Bachelor of Arts in English Education program. Candidates must meet certain benchmarks at three separate transition points in the program (admission to the program; admission to Clinical Practice year; and graduation/certification)."
