            "Master of Arts in Mathematics The Master of Arts in Mathematics program will provide an opportunity for individuals to pursue advanced study in mathematics and statistics as well as to develop skills that can lead to success in today’s technologically oriented society. Whether the goal involves applying mathematics and statistics to solve problems in business or industry, teaching in higher education, or preparing for further graduate study in mathematics or related fields, this program enables each student to pursue a course of study that is appropriate for their interests. The program requires students to complete 30 semester hours of work in one of the three concentrations: Pure Mathematics Applied Mathematics Statistics Each has its own course and graduation exit requirements, as outlined below. Rowan University undergraduates majoring in the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics can apply to the accelerated B.S./M.A. Advanced Dual Degree (4+1) program allowing them to earn both the Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts degrees in five years."
