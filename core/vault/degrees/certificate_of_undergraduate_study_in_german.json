            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in German The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in German may be declared in the Department of World Languages, Oak Hall 107, or by contacting the University Advising Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 323 (856-256-4459 / advise@rowan.edu). This program recognizes students’ completion of 12 s.h. in German, which corresponds to Intermediate-level proficiency in the language. Intermediate-level proficiency in a world language is a valuable credential, as it represents the ability to live independently in a foreign country with a substantial degree of success. In general, according to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), Intermediate-level speakers are able to create with the language, combining and recombining learned material to provide personal information, speak in sentences on a variety of familiar topics, ask questions, initiate, sustain and conclude a simple social or transactional task. For more information visit our website, Department of World Languages or contact the Department for the latest details."
