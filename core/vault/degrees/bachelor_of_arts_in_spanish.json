                "Bachelor of Arts in Spanish The Spanish Major, which may be declared either in the World Languages Department in Oak Hall 107 or with any of our advisors, offers a flexible curriculum that makes it possible to develop an intensive study of the Spanish language, its civilization, cultures and literatures. It also provides a general background for future professional studies and advanced degrees in Spanish as well as careers in a variety of fields, such as social, administrative, governmental work, and international business. Within the Spanish Major, four Concentrations are available in: (1) Applied Spanish, (2) Peninsular Spanish Literature & Culture, (3) Spanish American Literature & Culture, and (4) Spanish Translation & Interpretation. Each of these Concentrations seeks to provide recognition for students’ completion of 12 s.h. in the respective subject area. Literature courses in English translation cannot be counted for credit toward the major nor any course to be transferred in that did not have Spanish as the language of instruction. All incoming Spanish majors (Freshmen, Internal Transfers and Transfer Students) are required to take the “STAMP 4S” Spanish Placement Examination for initial placement, prior to registration; contact Esther Mas Serna, (mas@rowan.edu), Spanish Placement Coordinator, for details. Students of Appreciation of Hispanic Literature (SPAN 05301) are required to take the STAMP 4S Placement Exam a second time for assessment and advisement purposes in the major. All courses must be passed with a letter grade of “C-” or better and no courses may be taken P/NC. Students may transfer credits into the Spanish Major, including from Study Abroad. Students planning to Study Abroad must meet with their Spanish Advisor in order to determine course equivalents."
