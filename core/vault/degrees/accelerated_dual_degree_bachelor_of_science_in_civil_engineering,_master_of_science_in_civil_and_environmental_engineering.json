            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, Master of Science in Civil & Environmental Engineering The Accelerated Dual Degree Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, Master of Science in Civil Engineering offers students in the Civil & Environmental Engineering Department an unparalleled opportunity to fast-track their careers. With just one additional year of coursework, students can earn a master’s degree in civil engineering in addition to their BS degree, setting themselves apart in a competitive job market. Through our accelerated program, students take 12 credits of graduate-level courses in their final year of undergraduate studies. The remaining 18 credits of coursework can be taken in the summer, fall, and spring semesters. Students benefit from reduced tuition costs because the first 12 credits are covered by the full-time undergraduate tuition. By participating in this program, students gain advanced technical knowledge and develop a comprehensive understanding of CEE principles and practices, giving them a significant edge in their future careers."
