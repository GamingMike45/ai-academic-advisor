To be awarded the CUGS in Brewing Science, students must complete 12 s.h. in required courses and electives with at least a 2.0 average. Students must earn a C- in each course or they will be required to retake the course. There are no degree requirements nor required majors for enrollment as Brewing Science is a multi-disciplinary field. Any current Rowan student can declare the certificate given permission by the program director. Non-matriculated individuals currently working in the industry or looking to enter the industry are encouraged to apply for matriculation into the certificate through Rowan Global.
