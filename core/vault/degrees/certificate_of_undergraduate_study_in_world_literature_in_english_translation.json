            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in World Literature in English Translation The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in World Literature in English Translation may be declared in the Department of World Languages, Oak Hall 107, or by contacting the University Advising Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 323 (856-256-4459 / advise@rowan.edu). As our world becomes ever more global and interconnected, it is important for students not only to explore different literatures and cultures but also their interconnectedness. Such a program in literatures from different regions of the world allows students to consider texts within a global rather than a national framework as well as to recognize the various influences and interactions between literary traditions. For example, how do authors from different cultures address similar questions pertaining to the human condition? How do different political and economic contexts affect how authors write in similar genres and literary periods? By requiring the study of literary masterpieces from various traditions, students will be better equipped to answer such questions and to understand how culture, and more specifically literature, despite being profoundly impacted by its national context, is in fact never national, that it has always been and will continue to be profoundly global and interconnected. For more information visit our website, Department of World Languages or contact the Department for the latest details."
