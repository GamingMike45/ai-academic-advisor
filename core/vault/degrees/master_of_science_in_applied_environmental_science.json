            "Master of Science in Applied Environmental Science The Master of Science in Applied Environmental Science program will provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary to establish and advance their careers in environmental science in a wide range of professional settings including industry, consulting, education, and policy. Students will graduate from the program ready to apply adaptive management strategies to address and mitigate real world environmental problems. The M.S. in Applied Environmental Science will offer coursework that addresses the needs of environmental consulting companies and other potential employers such as those in the offshore wind industry. This M.S. will provide students with both the theoretical foundations and opportunities to apply techniques and methods that are standard in the field of environmental science. Students will be coming from a variety of backgrounds and so will choose foundational courses in consultation with an advisor, depending on their academic and professional backgrounds. The number of courses offered reflects the diversity of student preparation. Students who lack sufficient preparation in Environmental Science may need to take additional foundational courses without credit towards the degree. The MS in Applied Environmental Science is a 30- credit degree that prepares students for careers in Environmental Management. The MS in Applied Environmental Science curriculum is divided into three categories: Foundational coursework (9 s.h.) Required Courses (6 s.h.) Elective Courses (15 s.h.). The International option in Applied Environmental Science requires an international internship experience Students who pursue the optional International track must take an international internship (3 s.h.). Students who participate in international internships that award more than 3 s.h. may apply up to 6 s.h. towards their electives."
