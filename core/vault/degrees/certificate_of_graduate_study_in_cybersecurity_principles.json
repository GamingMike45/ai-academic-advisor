            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Cybersecurity Principles The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Cybersecurity Principles is designed to prepare students with the knowledge and skills needed to understand key issues along with present and emerging cyber threats to information systems. Students will be able to articulate the core concepts of cybersecurity, asset protection and cyber defense, learn specific techniques for vulnerability analysis and security risk assessment, and understand how to build a technical architecture which includes security considerations and analyze technical policies and processes. Students seeking this COGS will be required to complete any four (4) of the required courses. The COGS is a stackable certificate, and students can apply their certificate credits toward the M.S. in Cyber Security. Students may also apply some of their certificate credits toward the M.S. in Computer Science. Students should consult with the program advisor for additional information."
