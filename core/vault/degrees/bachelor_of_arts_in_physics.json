            "Bachelor of Arts in Physics The Bachelor of Arts Program in Physics provides students with a flexible program in physics with enough room in electives to tailor it for their own needs. The degree is designed primarily for those students wishing to complete a double major or earn a minor (or two). Example careers for those with this degree include high school physics teaching, middle-school general science teaching, environmental science, marketing or sales representative for a technical industry, technical writing, medicine, or law. The BA can also be combined with the Master of Arts in STEM Education in an Accelerated Dual Degree Program."
