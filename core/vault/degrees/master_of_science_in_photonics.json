            "Master of Science in Photonics The M.S. in Photonics program allows students to obtain advanced knowledge in photonics and expand their skill sets in emerging topics of interest. This interdisciplinary program covers a wide variety of topics such as optical design, laser physics, fiber-optics, and electro-optic devices. The program will prepare students with the necessary knowledge and skills for careers in optics & photonics. Thesis and non-thesis (course-only) tracks are available, both of which require a total of 30 credits. For the thesis track, 6 of the 30 credits come from original research that culminates in a thesis. For the non-thesis option, all 30 credits come from coursework."
