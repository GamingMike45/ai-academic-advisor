            "Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The PhD in Engineering is a terminal degree program that is designed to meet the changing needs of researchers, scholars, and scientists in academia, industry, and the government. The primary goal of this program is, therefore, to prepare students for careers in research and/or academics by providing an environment that closely reflects the realities and expectations encountered by today’s academicians, professional scientists, and research engineers. The program is designed to offer a highly flexible inter and multi-disciplinary curricular structure, allowing a focus in any (or multiple) of the traditional or emerging engineering disciplines. The primary strength of the program is involving students in activities that they are most likely to encounter in real-world academic or industrial settings. Students work closely with their academic and research advisors to tailor a custom program of research, coursework, technical communication, and professional development. Detailed admissions requirements could be found at: https://global.rowan.edu/programs/phd-in-engineering.html. Application deadlines are April 1st, July 1st, and November 1st.
