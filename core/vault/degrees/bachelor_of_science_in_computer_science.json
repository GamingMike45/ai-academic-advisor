            "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science This program focuses on developing flexible professionals who are equipped to learn new technologies and principles that are essential for success in such a rapidly evolving field. Students will learn how to apply advanced scientific and industrial methodologies, knowledge of mathematics, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory to develop computing solutions and demonstrate these skills through presentations, written work, and projects. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science contains several optional concentrations and a wide range of advanced electives. This degree prepares graduates for jobs in business and industry, as well as further study at the graduate level. The Computer Science major requires courses in mathematics and applied and theoretical computer science. Students, in consultation with faculty advisors, can construct flexible and comprehensive programs. The program prepares students for graduate study in computer science or such related fields as business, operations research, and information sciences. Graduates also find careers in business, industry, government, and education, where they work as applications programmers, scientific programmers, systems programmers, systems analysts, and software engineers. It is recommended that the students who are entering the program have several years of high school mathematics and programming courses. Advanced placement credit is accepted for incoming freshmen students. A grade of C- or better in the following courses is required for graduation: Calculus I, Discrete Structures, Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, Object-Oriented Programming and Data Abstraction, Computer Organization, and Data Structures and Algorithms, whether they are taken locally or are transferred."
