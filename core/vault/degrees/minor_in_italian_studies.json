            "Minor in Italian Studies The Italian Studies Minor may be declared in the Department of World Languages, Oak Hall 107 or by contacting the University Advising Center, Savitz Hall, Suite 323 (856.256.4459 / advise@rowan.edu). This program allows students to add to their linguistic proficiency in Italian as well as their cultural, social and historical competence, which will benefit them on the job market, especially considering the strong presence of Italian companies, business activities, and institutions in our territory (i.e. foreign and public service, international sales and business, humanitarian work, government, politics, international law). The program will also support students’ growth and development as global citizens and will prepare them to interact with a different population and culture with greater cultural awareness and sensitivity, in accordance with the mission of the Department of World Languages. This 18 s.h. minor is open to all students. A placement interview is strongly recommended for students with previous knowledge of Italian so that they may begin their Italian language study at the appropriate level. For placement interview information, please contact Dr. Alessandra Mirra at mirra@rowan.edu. Students may earn the credits for any skipped courses via the Authorization for Credit by Examination process and these credits are counted in fulfillment of minor requirements. All courses must be passed with a letter grade of “C-” or better and no courses may be taken P/NC. Students  may transfer credits into the Italian Studies Minor, including from study abroad; student splanning to study abroad must meet with their Advisor in order to determine course equivalents. The Minor in Italian Studies consists of 6 courses (18 credits). Students must receive a grade of at least “C-” in all courses for the program. Each of the courses listed below is worth 3 credits."
