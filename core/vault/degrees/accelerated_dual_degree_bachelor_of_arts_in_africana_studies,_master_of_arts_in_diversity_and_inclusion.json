            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Arts in Africana Studies, Master of Arts in Diversity & Inclusion Overview This accelerated dual degree program offers students an opportunity to earn a B.A. in Africana Studies and an M.A. in Diversity & Inclusion in five years. Students may apply to the program after earning at least 60 credits or, for transfer students, after earning 15 credits at Rowan. The 12 graduate credits will be applied towards the undergraduate program as well as the graduate program, i.e. students only need to earn 108 undergraduate credits. In addition to earning an M. A. more quickly, students in this program will save tuition through taking 12 credits of M.A. courses as a senior at undergraduate tuition rates."
