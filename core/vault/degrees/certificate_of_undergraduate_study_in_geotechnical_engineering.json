            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Geotechnical Engineering The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Geotechnical Engineering will allow students to take courses specific to Geotechnical Engineering as well as courses that will establish a background in the related field of Geology. This will allow students to graduate from Rowan University better prepared for a career specifically in geotechnical engineering than they would with just the BS degree, and provide them with an additional credential beyond the BS, yet prior to earning a MS degree."
