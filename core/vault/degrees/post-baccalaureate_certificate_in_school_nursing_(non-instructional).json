            "Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in School Nursing (Non-Instructional) The vision of the Post-Baccalaureate Certification in School Nursing (Non-Instructional) Program at Rowan University is to prepare school nurses, who are licensed to practice nursing in New Jersey, to meet the health and education challenges of the twenty-first century. The role of the school nurse has substantially increased, making it necessary for our program to have a broad and deep interdisciplinary and knowledge-based approach. It allows the school nurse to become a productive member of an educational multidisciplinary team that links education with the psychosocial and medical needs of children. The National Coalition for School Health stated that baccalaureate programs for school nurses should emphasize public/community health nursing concepts and principles, including school nursing and community assessment with a practicum clinical experience. The Rowan University Post-Baccalaureate Certification in School Nursing (Non-Instructional) Program is designed to meet that research in concert with the New Jersey Administrative Code requirements for the Educational Services Certificate Endorsement for School Nurse (Non-Instructional), and with the National School Nurses Association. It recognizes the school nurse has a central management role in the implementation of health services. Our goal is to help candidates to become leaders in establishing links to the community, assessing needs and resources of the school community, and developing or modifying school health services. School nursing is a specialty practice that requires the school nurse to have a knowledge base that will allow for flexibility in the anticipation of change and to be proactive as a member of a consultative multidisciplinary team. This specialization requires knowledge of program planning, administrative delegation, and legal issues as they relate to caring for all students in an inclusive educational setting. Most nurses enter school nursing practice with education that is not specific to school nursing and with skills acquired in other nursing roles, often in acute care. As licensed health professionals, school nurses are expected to perform independent, high-quality care in a non-medical setting. This poses significant challenges not experienced by nurses working in settings with a medical/health focus. Schools can lack the procedural safeguards for nurses that can be found in health care settings, in terms of health-related policies and procedures. In addition, the role of the school nurse is poorly understood by stakeholders (parents, school staff, and administrators), as well as among other nurses. Nevertheless, school nurses serve in pivotal roles that bridge health care and education (National Association of School Nurses, 2016). “Keeping children healthy, safe, in school, and ready to learn should be a top priority for both healthcare and educational systems. With approximately 55.9 million candidates in public and private elementary and secondary schools, educational institutions are excellent locations to promote health in children, and the school nurse is uniquely positioned to meet candidate health needs” (NASN, 2016). However, the reality is that the focus of schools is on education, not health, and the connection between the two is, unfortunately, underrecognized in the K-12 setting. As school nurses provide care to a diverse student body with a variety of acute, chronic, and complex health care needs, it is imperative that they have opportunities to practice higher-level nursing skills and reflect on their practice. Successful transition to practice depends on a balance of nursing knowledge and skills, and collaboration between school nurse candidates, cooperating school nurse mentors, and university faculty. Program Features Dedicated school nurses serve an essential function in the school community by protecting and promoting students’ health. The Post-Baccalaureate Certification in School Nursing (Non-Instructional) program at Rowan University, through the College of Education, prepares New Jersey licensed registered nurses who hold a bachelor’s degree to assume a multifaceted role that supports the physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being of students in public schools in preschool through grade 12. This flexible hybrid program builds upon a nurse’s healthcare experiences, which will best qualify them for the interdisciplinary aspects of school health. Students will learn the functions of the school nurse and how he/she is a vital part of the educational team. Upon completion of the program, students are eligible for NJDOE School Nursing (Non-Instructional) Certification. This certification does NOT authorize the teaching in areas related to health.

Maintaining a 3.0 GPA is necessary for retention in the program. If a student earns less than a B minus in any required coursework, the course must be repeated. School nursing students must work with a NJ State Certified school nurse for all clinical hours. Program Evaluation Students will be subjected to three evaluation points during the program. At each point, empirical data on candidate performance and program effectiveness will be collected using checklists, rubrics, candidate self- assessments and course evaluation.
