            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Science in Physics, Master of Science in Data Science Overview The Departments of Physics & Astronomy, Computer Science, and Mathematics have created a combined dual program earning the BS in Physics and the MS in Data Science in a five (5) year time by applying four (4) graduate course in the undergraduate degree program with the added benefit that the cost for those credits are at the undergraduate tuition rate. The program combines the problem solving skills of the Physics degree with programming and analysis skills of the Data Science degree to create graduates who are well positioned for the multitude of jobs in “big data” across many disciplines and fields."

                "Total Required Credits for the Program: 138 s.h. Graduate courses marked with * above may be counted in the 120 s.h. undergraduate program a maximum of 12 s.h., and no more than two (2) from the Electives bank. Requirements for Admission: The Accelerated Dual Degree program is open to all matriculated undergraduates. Undergraduates in the program will submit applications for admission to the graduate program in the fall semester of their sophomore year of the undergraduate program. (This typically means after having 45 credits in their Physics program, including Introductory Electricity and Magnetism as well as Calculus III and Linear Algebra). Application requirements are as follows: A minimum overall GPA of 3.0 in undergraduate coursework and 3.5 in the major. A complete online Rowan Global application, including all required documents. Requirements for Graduation: In order to graduate from the program with a BS in Physics and MS in Data Science all students must meet the following two requirements: Completion of all the requirements for the BS in Physics with 12 semester hours of graduate Data Analytics courses taken by the student in their fourth year to be counted as restricted electives. Completion of all requirements for the MS in Data Science including the 4 core courses and a total of 30 credits. Contingency for Students who do not Complete Master of Science program: If the student “opts out” before 12 graduate credits have been completed, any remaining credits needed for 120 credits required for the undergraduate degree will be taken at the undergraduate level and selected through consultation between the advisor, the Physics department and the student.",
