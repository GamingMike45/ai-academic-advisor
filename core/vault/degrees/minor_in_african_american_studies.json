            "Minor in African American Studies The African American Studies Minor consists of interdisciplinary curricular offerings that engage faculty and students in critical analysis, reflection and transformational thinking about African Americans within the framework of the multicultural diversity and global connectedness of American society. The African American Studies Program dates back to the late 1960s when the Civil Rights Movement across the nation and the Southern New Jersey region led to the establishment of the King Scholar Program (The Educational Opportunity Fund or EOF Program) in the Fall of 1968. Following the offering of the first Black History course by the History Department in 1969 in response to Black student demands, a slow but steady growth in African American and African curricular offerings over the course of the next two decades culminated in the formal establishment of the African American Studies minor in 1989. To complete the 18 semester hours of course work required for the minor, students should take six semester hours of requirements and an additional twelve semester hours of electives selected from the related elective courses listed below. Overall, the 18 semester hours of course work completed for the minor must include offerings from at least three academic departments. Students interested in pursuing the minor are encouraged to sign up in the RU Office of Career Advancement and to contact the coordinator for further information and advisement."
