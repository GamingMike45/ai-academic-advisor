            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Regenerative Food Systems The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Regenerative Food Systems provides students with a perspective on changes within the food system over time since the green revolution and the introduction of agrochemicals leading to modern food issues and planetary environmental challenges derived from exceeding Earth’s carrying capacity. Topics include US and global food systems driven by ‘big food’ agribusiness, essentials of regenerative and sustainability principles with options to study agricultural practices, food start-ups, or global food issues in order to provide students with opportunities to identify potential solutions. Students will explore the dimensional relationships between actors across food supply chains and how changes, when implemented, have effects on other actors of the supply chain."
