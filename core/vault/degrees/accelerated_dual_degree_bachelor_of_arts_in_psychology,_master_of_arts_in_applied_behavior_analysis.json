            "Accelerated Dual Degree: Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, Master of Arts in Applied Behavior Analysis Overview The Accelerated Dual Degree program allows students to complete both a BA degree with a major in Psychology and a Master of Arts in Applied Behavior Analysis in five years. In this accelerated dual undergraduate/graduate degree program, the acceleration is achieved by substituting 12 credits of graduate coursework for 12 credits of undergraduate coursework (specifically, elective credits), thus reducing the total number of credit hours required for the two degrees individually. Further, the accelerated dual degree program avoids the duplication of content required in both undergraduate and graduate-level courses in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). In addition to earning an MA more quickly, students in this program will save on tuition by taking 12 credits of MA courses as a senior at undergraduate tuition rates. Applied Behavior Analysis involves using well-established and empirically supported principles to assess and treat an array of behavioral concerns. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has been empirically shown to be effective in a wide variety of areas and has received the most recognition for developing effective and ethical behavioral services and supports for individuals with developmental disabilities and autism, including the treatment of severe behavior. The Applied Behavior Analysis Licensing Act was signed into law in the State of New Jersey in 2020 and will require a professional license for individuals to practice ABA, providing critical protections for consumers and a foundation for workforce development initiatives that will ensure access to quality ABA services provided by trained and ethical professionals. The requirements to become a Licensed Behavior Analyst (LBA) in the State of New Jersey will include 1) a graduate degree from an accredited university and 2) current certification as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst® (BCBA) or equivalent. The Master of Arts in Applied Behavior Analysis fulfills the degree and coursework requirements for becoming a BCBA. Our program meets the behavior-analytic coursework requirements for those pursuing the BCBA/BCaBA Pathway 2 eligibility route. Applicants will need to meet additional requirements before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination. For more information on becoming a BCBA®, see the BACB Behavior Analyst Certification Board® (BACB®) standards at www.bacb.com."
