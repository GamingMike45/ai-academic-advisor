                "Bachelor of Arts in Economics In Economics, students acquire skills for analyzing important and stimulating national and global problems. Various possible solutions are developed. Economics deals with many current issues facing our society, such as energy, inflation, unemployment, pollution, urban decay, as well as foreign trade and government budget deficits. The study of Economics prepares students for graduate studies or careers in the private sector, government services, teaching, or research. Graduates with the Bachelor of Arts degree find that employment opportunities are greatest in business and government. There are two programs of study: (1) Bachelor of Arts program requiring 36 hours in economics; and (2) a minor requiring 21 hours in economics. Program-Specific Graduation Requirements for this Major Students must receive a grade of C- or better in all Economics classes and MATH 03125 or MATH 01130 and STAT 02260 Principles of Economics: A Survey (ECON 04303) cannot count towards economics major or minor credits. Economics majors may use the Pass/No Credit option for only two economics courses: These courses are the two introductory courses: ECON04101 (Intro Macroeconomics) and ECON04102 (Intro Microeconomics)."
