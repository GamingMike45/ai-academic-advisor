            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Writing Studies for Educators The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Writing Studies for Educators provides broad-based study and practice in a variety of writing forms, creative and expository, personal and public, that complement courses in Education. Students learn how writers compose in print and new media forms and how audiences react to their writing. In classroom workshops and peer response groups, through lecture and discussion, and by creating and composing multiple drafts and revisions, students develop sensitivity to rhetorical considerations of audience, purpose, and genre. This CUGS allows students who are interested to credential themselves within the field of Writing Studies without majoring or minoring in Writing Arts."
