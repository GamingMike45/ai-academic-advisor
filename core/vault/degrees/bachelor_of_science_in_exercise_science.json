            "Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science The Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science prepares students interested in careers related to the field of Exercise Science. These include Clinical Exercise Physiology, Strength and Conditioning, Corporate Fitness, Medical and Community-Based Fitness and Wellness Centers, as well as other Exercise Science-related fields. Graduates will be prepared to earn national certifications through organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine, the National Strength and Conditioning Association, the National Academy of Sports Medicine, and the International Society of Sports Nutrition, among others. The Exercise Science major is accredited through the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs . The primary role of this accreditation is to establish standards and guidelines for academic programs that facilitate the preparation of students seeking employment in the health, fitness, and exercise science industry. The Exercise Science major is recognized by the National Strength and Conditioning Association’s Education Recognition Program . This program recognizes and distinguishes schools with standardized, approved strength and conditioning curricula in undergraduate and graduate settings designed to prepare students for the NSCA Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist® (CSCS®) certification. In the Fall of 2027, the program will be preparing for a second accreditation through the Council on Accreditation for Strength and Conditioning Education . Its mission is to establish and maintain standards of excellence for strength and conditioning degree programs, ensuring consistent, quality education that prepares graduates for the field. Degree Requirements To complete the program, students must have a minimum 2.00 overall GPA, 2.00 GPA in the major. Students must earn a minimum of a C- in all major courses."
