            "Minor in Electrical & Computer Engineering The Minor in Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) offers students majoring in disciplines other than ECE the opportunity to become familiar with principles and design practices used to meet the multidisciplinary needs of modern technology. This minor is offered by the faculty of the ECE program and is designed to serve students from other engineering disciplines as well as those students with majors outside of engineering. It is assumed that students who pursue the ECE minor will obtain a mathematics background that is comparable to that required for a major in engineering. The ECE minor stipulates 11 semester credit hours of required courses that provide a fundamental grounding in ECE knowledge and design. These courses include an overview of ECE as a field, an introduction to digital circuit design, theory-based courses in both analog circuits and modern electronics. In addition to these fundamental courses, 3 elective courses assure the students an opportunity to emphasize a particular area of interest."
