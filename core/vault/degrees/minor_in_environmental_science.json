                "Minor in Environmental Science The Minor in Environmental Science offers students an opportunity majoring in disciplines other than EVSC to explore some of the issues and problems integral to Environmental Science without committing to the full major. It is well suited to students from Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, and other life and physical sciences. Environmental Studies majors will also benefit from the added scientific dimension. Students will gain exposure to major environmental issues in one EVSC 100- level Gateway course and EVSC 01115 - Environment in the Headlines (required). Environmental Science requires a basic knowledge of chemistry and the physical earth and so minors are required to take introductory courses from both of those disciplines (7-8 s.h.). Two EVSC electives (6 s.h.) will allow students to explore area of environmental science of interest at a deeper level, supported by the chemistry and geology courses. Students should choose electives based on their background."
