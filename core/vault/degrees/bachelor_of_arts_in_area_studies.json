            "Bachelor of Arts in Area Studies The Area Studies major offers concentration options in Asian Studies, European Studies, and Latin American Studies. This program is inclusive and offers a diverse educational experience in terms of its interdisciplinary content, which includes subject matter from a variety of fields, including elective options in language, history, literature, geography, political science, sociology, anthropology, art, music, philosophy, and religion, among others. Students also take comparative global courses to help them contextualize their specific area of focus. Within the program, students draw connections between different academic approaches to understand the diversity, influence, and complexity of the area under study. The cultural competence and language proficiency students gain through this program will prepare them to interact with and contribute to diverse populations with greater cultural awareness and sensitivity. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary foundation and core liberal arts career skills in critical thinking, research, and communication that the program develops enhance our students’ preparation for graduate study, such as in the fields of area studies, international studies, international development, public policy, and law, as well as a wide variety of careers, including foreign and public service, international sales and business, humanitarian work, government, politics, international law, and global health care, both abroad and with populations at home in the United States."
