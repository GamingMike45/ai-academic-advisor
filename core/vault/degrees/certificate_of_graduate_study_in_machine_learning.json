            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Machine Learning The Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Machine Learning is a program designed to provide a breadth and depth to students who want to specialize in one of the fastest growing fields of all sciences and engineering. The Machine Learning COGS will provide breadth and depth in theoretical foundations of machine learning, as well as a year-long practical hands-on real-world project experience. The completion of this COGS will provide students with the necessary tools to start a career in machine learning as it applies to engineering and/or continue their education through graduate programs."
