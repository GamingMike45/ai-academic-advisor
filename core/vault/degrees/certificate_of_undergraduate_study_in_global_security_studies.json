            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Global Security Studies The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Global Security Studies is designed to provide students with a strong introduction to this crucially important interdisciplinary field. Students take 1) two required courses that cover the range of issues and approaches in international security and 2) two electives drawn from theme-based banks relating to environmental security, health security, disaster response, and conflict and terrorism. This CUGS will enrich the academic experience of students who are interested in international issues and who want to pursue specialized graduate training or to work in the government sector (counterintelligence, national security, or diplomacy, for example), the military, intergovernmental agencies, the private sector, academic institutions, and the non-profit/humanitarian sector."
