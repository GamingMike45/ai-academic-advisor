            "Bachelor of Science in Chemistry The BS degree in Chemistry, accredited by the American Chemical Society, prepares students for a scientific career in chemistry or graduate studies. Successful completion of the degree requirements can also increase the chances of success in chemical industry (eg. pharmaceutical, materials, polymer, paint, fragrance, fine chemical, etc.) or government jobs (eg. EPA, FDA, NSF, NIST, etc.). The program combines the value of a liberal education with appropriate classroom and laboratory training in chemistry, math, physics, and biology. The curriculum is an assimilation of the core elements of all five sub-areas of chemistry including analytical, biochemistry, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. The emphasis in all courses is on the acquisition of a solid knowledge base combined with hands-on laboratory training. Laboratories are equipped with modern instrumentation and computers for hands-on use by students at all levels. The capstone experience is a seminar course and each student is expected to carry out a laboratory-based research project as well."
