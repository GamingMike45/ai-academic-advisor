            "Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology The Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology, through a four-field approach (cultural, physical/biological, linguistic, and archaeology), prepares students for a variety of career opportunities in research, teaching, development, advocacy, health care among diverse populations, consumer research, community-based organizations, non-profits, and public service. Anthropology Majors will have the option of concentrating their studies in one of four subfield tracks. These are physical/forensic anthropology, public culture/museum studies, medical anthropology, and archaeology/cultural resource management. The BA Anthropology degree will also support those students who wish to pursue further study in graduate or professional schools. By acquiring an anthropological perspective on diversity, culture, and ethnography as well as developing strong social and natural scientific research skills, students will expand their career opportunities."
