            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Geospatial Science & Methods Geospatial and mapping technologies are integral to many modern scientific, commercial, and academic activities and draw on the long history of cartographic and data visualization. This Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS) in Geospatial Science & Methods provides an introduction to how information becomes data that can be presented visually in the form of a map, to communicate to an audience, yield new analytical insights, or present patterns and relationships unavailable in other forms and continues to advanced analytical modes using various spatial data types. This COGS in Geospatial Science & Methods is intended to expose students with previous undergraduate experience in disciplines such as engineering, disaster management and emergency preparedness, public health, business, social sciences, communication, the natural and environmental sciences, and education to key concepts, practices, and techniques in GIS and their application to geospatial/environmental problems. With three required courses, students can demonstrate their competence and familiarity with key spatial data preparation, analysis, and visualization techniques that may complement and enhance preparedness for a wide variety of occupations and disciplines. This COGS is specifically targeted toward students who do not yet have a background in geospatial methods, such as those coming from Engineering, Planning, Biosciences, Humanities, or other disciplines, but it could complement the previous experience of students who had taken some coursework in Geography and GIS (especially by focusing on advanced courses in the choice bank).  With this program, students from across the university can integrate geospatial data and methods into their chosen graduate curriculum."
