            "Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study in Applied Behavior Analysis Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) involves the use of well-established and empirically supported principles to address behavioral concerns and facilitate skill acquisition. ABA has been empirically shown to be effective in a wide variety of areas and has received the most recognition for its success in designing and providing behavioral supports for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disabilities. Our program meets the behavior-analytic coursework requirements for those pursuing the BCBA/BCaBA Pathway 2 eligibility route. Students applying to this program must possess a minimum of a master’s degree from an accredited university. The Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study (CAGS) in ABA program does not provide the supervised experience requirement for eligibility to take the BCBA® exam. For more information on these requirements, please visit the Behavior Analyst Board Certification (BACB@), Inc. at www.bacb.com."
