            "Post-Baccalaureate Teacher of Students With Disabilities Endorsement This program leads to the Teacher of Students with Disabilities (TOSD) Endorsement and is available to students in two ways. A student can be enrolled as an undergraduate in one of the College of Education’s initial endorsement programs. The other option is open to those who currently hold a bachelor’s degree and are eligible for at least a certificate of eligibility (CE) in elementary education, early childhood education, subject matter education, or physical and health education. The Teacher of Students with Disabilities Endorsement is only granted when a student has successfully fulfilled all requirements for an initial teaching certification. Some course substitutions are permitted for certain education majors; however, students MUST consult with their advisors for detailed information. Students entering the program must have at least a 2.75 GPA. In order to be eligible for the TOSD Endorsement, students must have a program GPA of 3.0 or higher across all required TOSD coursework. Students must also receive a “B-” or above in all TOSD courses. A student receiving a “C+” or lower in any TOSD Post-Bac course will be required to repeat the course and placed on program probation."
