            "Minor in Psychology of Sport & Exercise The goal of the Psychology of Sport & Exercise minor is to enhance knowledge in the field of psychology as it pertains to sport & exercise performance. The objective of the minor is to provide concepts of psychology and exercise as they relate to behavioral theories, physiological processes, social psychology of sport & exercise, and psychological modalities related to performance in a sport & exercise environment. This minor will be valuable to students interested in working in health & healthcare professions (e.g., strength and conditioning coaches, occupational and physical therapists, athletic trainers, educators, health behavior coaches, etc.) because data shows that understanding the psychology involved in sport & exercise is critical to providing quality whole-body care and enhancing performance when working with potential clients, patients, and athletes. Completing this minor in Psychology of Sport & Exercise will also prepare students that are interested in obtaining a graduate degree in psychology and enhance their ability to get a job without a graduate degree by being marketable as having knowledge of theoretical framework and modalities in enhancing the well-being of clients in their health & healthcare profession."
