            "Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN to BSN) The Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing is offered jointly by the Virtual Health School of Nursing & Health Professions at Rowan University and the Division of Global Learning & Partnerships. It is designed to give additional professional education at the baccalaureate level to practicing nurses. The BSN degree prepares registered nurses to work in the ever-expanding field of nursing. This degree allows nurses to augment their knowledge base and thus enhance their careers. The Bachelor of Science Degree also acts as a steppingstone for the nurse who wishes to pursue a Master of Science Degree in Nursing with six graduate nursing credits included in the program curriculum. The program is designed as a part-time program to accommodate professionals’ schedules while still completing the degree in a timely manner. RN-to-BSN Curriculum The complete curriculum includes 120 credits: 30 credits in the RN-to-BSN major, and 60 credits of general education and foundational courses required by Rowan University for graduation from any bachelor’s degree program, and 30 credits of pre-licensure nursing coursework. Students graduating from an Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) associate degree or diploma program are awarded 30 pre-licensure nursing credits upon matriculation into the program. Students transfer credits for coursework completed prior to admission to the program. Degree candidates are encouraged to plan a course of study that meets both the programmatic criteria as well as courses that meet their individual needs and interests. Students may transfer up to 90 credits Students must fulfill the Rowan Core requirements of Rowan University, either through the transfer of credits or completion of courses at Rowan University Additional coursework may be required, depending on the amount of credits transferred to Rowan University Program must be completed on a part-time basis.
