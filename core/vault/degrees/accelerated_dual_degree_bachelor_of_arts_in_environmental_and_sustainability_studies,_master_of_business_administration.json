                "Total Required Credits for the Entire ADD Program: 144 s.h. Graduation To graduate from this accelerated dual degree program with a BA and an MBA, students must: Complete all requirements for the BA in Environmental & Sustainability Studies, including any General Education / Rowan Experience / Rowan Core requirements; Earn a grade of C or better in all undergraduate courses required by the BA in Environmental & Sustainability Studies and undergraduate prereqs for the MBA program; Complete all prerequisites for the MBA program; Complete all requirements for the MBA, which is a “Category 3” program at Rowan. Category 3 program students must: Earn no more than two total “C” grades of any combination of “C+” or “C.” (C- grades are not acceptable.); earn no grades lower than a “C”; earn an official cumulative GPA (according to matriculation level) of at least 3.000 on Rowan’s 4.000 scale Students who enter the combined program but do not maintain satisfactory progress or who simply choose to not continue pursuing the MBA degree will be allowed to apply up to 12 credits of graduate coursework to the undergraduate degree in Environmental & Sustainability Studies. If the student “opts out” before 12 graduate credits have been completed, any remaining credits needed for the 120 credits required for the undergraduate degree will be selected through consultation between the Environmental & Sustainability Studies academic advisor, the Program Coordinator for Environmental & Sustainability Studies, and the student. The Program Coordinator for Environmental & Sustainability Studies will meet with students who do not meet the criteria outlined above, and/or who have not gained permission to take graduate-level courses, to discuss the best alternative for the student. It is most likely that students who opt out of graduate-level courses or do not meet the criteria to take graduate-level courses will graduate with a BA in Environmental & Sustainability Studies and possibly a minor in business administration. For information related to this major or minor, please contact: Jordan Howell, Ph.D. 856.256.4831 howellj@rowan.edu",
