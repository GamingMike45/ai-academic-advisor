            "Certificate of Graduate Study in Creative Writing By participating in a curriculum that combines the writing workshop model with the study of craft through a close reading of published texts, students will engage in the advanced practices of the genres of their choice. They will learn to engage in a process of composition that, when combined with the development of a critical vocabulary, allows students to give, receive, and use criticism in their revisions. As they discover and develop their individual style, voice, and literary vision, they will acquire the discipline and the creative and organizational strategies necessary to prepare for and advance them toward publication."
