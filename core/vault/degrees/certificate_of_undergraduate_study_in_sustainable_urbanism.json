            "Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Sustainable Urbanism Two global imperatives make knowledge of sustainable urbanism a critical topic in the 21st century: first, the majority of the world’s population is now urban; and second, the cumulative effects of urban life are generating the most pressing global environmental problems facing humanity. Cities, in short, are both the cause of major environmental problems and the solution. With our population expected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050, humanity’s future is hinged upon our ability to make cities sustainable: the capacity to meet the needs of the present, without comprising the needs of future generations. To support humanity in the 21st century, we must re-think the processes of urban environments in regard to both their built form and social practices. This Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) emphasizes the social and place-based dimensions of sustainability, from issues of social equity to the role of communication technologies and aesthetics. Students in disciplines such as business, engineering, political science, psychology, communication, the natural sciences, and education will be exposed to key concepts, practices, and technologies in sustainability and their application to urban environments. This certificate in sustainable urbanism will position students from diverse disciplines for employment in the burgeoning green economy."
