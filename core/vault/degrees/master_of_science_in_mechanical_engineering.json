            "Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering The Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering program at Rowan University effectively prepares individuals to respond to the changing needs of today’s engineers. This program provides students with the necessary knowledge, skill sets, and training to successfully contribute to the engineering workforce. Students have access to higher level courses leading to a graduate degree and are involved in professional development opportunities which increase their breadth of understanding and application of engineering principles. Students can choose between a thesis track and a coursework track. Students may also work on a project, which may be counted toward a coursework track degree. Full-time students work on funded research projects leading to a thesis or select the coursework track. Most part-time students select the coursework track. In order to be eligible for a Research Assistantship, students must select the thesis track. Both tracks of the MS in Mechanical Engineering program permit students to deeply explore engineering design and analysis, and for some students, also provide an opportunity for practical training that can further complement these explorations. The interdisciplinary nature of this program provides students with an opportunity to take coursework in and/or conduct research on exciting research areas at the leading edge of Mechanical Engineering technology. This program includes focus areas in Bioengineering, Mechanics, Materials, Thermal and Fluid Sciences, Nanotechnology, Manufacturing, Robotics, Devices, and Systems Engineering. Tracks The program includes two tracks. Each has different course and graduation exit requirements which are outlined below. Thesis Track: The thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours, 6-9 of which involve pursuit of a thesis research/engineering project. Non-Thesis Track: The non-thesis option requires the completion of 30 semester hours of coursework."

                "Total Required Credits for the Program: 30 s.h. Foundation Courses The following undergraduate courses or their substantial equivalents must be successfully completed at an accredited institution: Chemistry I; Physics I; Calculus I, II, and III; Linear Algebra; and Differential Equations. Additional foundation courses may be required as conditions of program admission. Students with out-of-discipline/non-ME background are required to take two foundational undergraduate courses (ENGR 01273 Strength of Materials and ME 10310 Introduction to Thermal-Fluid Sciences) and are encouraged to contact the Program Advisor for any additional information or requirements prior to enrolling in the MS ME program. Graduation/Exit, Benchmark, and Thesis Requirements If thesis track is selected, students will register for 6-9 s.h. of Master’s Research and must successfully complete and defend the Master’s Thesis. Minimum Required Grades and Cumulative GPA The Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering is a Category 2 program. Under this program, students must earn no grades lower than a B- and must achieve a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 out of 4.0.
