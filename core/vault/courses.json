        "Description": "MBS 00616 - Biomedical Data Analysis Credits: 3 This course is intended to serve as a practical guide to analyzing biological and biomedical data.  We will begin by introducing basic data representation concepts, followed by selected topics in introductory probability and statistics, which will provide the basis for the data analysis techniques introduced towards the end of the course.  The latter include t-tests, ANOVA, correlation and regression as well as selected non-parametric methods.  The emphasis of this course is on real-life biomedical data problem solving via worked out example cases in class sessions as well as via independent problem-solving homework assignments.  While the focus is on practical applications, effective data analysis does require a basic understanding of the principles on which data analysis tools are built.  Therefore, the course will provide a fairly robust, albeit intuitive, introduction to basic probability and mathematical statistics. However, formal mathematical derivations will be avoided wherever possible and mathematical statistical concepts will be introduced only if complementary to the courses practical applications focus.  Students are not expected to have a background in higher mathematics (i.e. calculus or linear algebra) nor any prior experience with probability, statistics and data analysis.

This course examines the links between the body and voice and focuses on the actors primary impulse to breathe and therefore to move, make sound, and eventually articulate a thought, an emotion, and a desire. Our speaking voice is rarely required to move beyond a very thin band of pitch, tone, breath and articulation. The vocal work in this course intends to open up the socialized voice to discover the enormous potential that lies within.  Through exercises designed to expand the spoken voice, student will gain control of the voice as a creative tool toward original performance.  This course draws on the voice training methodologies of Roy Hart, Fitzmaurice, and Linklater. Polands Gardiniezce and Swedens Teater Slava who practice this vocal training are also covered in the voice curriculum, requiring students to listen, to blend sounds, to tune as an ensemble and to find theatrical power in achieving a choral voice.

Though some suburbs are still bedroom communities in which live commuters to a central city, most suburban residents now live, work, and play entirely in suburbia. Suburbs are no longer sub to the urban. The course begins with an overview of the economic and transportation changes that made suburbia possible, as well as the government policy and cultural forces that caused Americans to move to suburbs. The role of suburbia in creating and supporting particular ideas of race, class, and gender are discussed, and popular representations of suburbia are analyzed and challenges.

Gut-wrenching disaster investigations have yielded an industry that is statistically exemplar today, but is still subject to the same lens. This course is designed to explore where air accidents are most likely to occur and why this is so. Factors including altitude, runway orientation, weather, language and customs, delays, and pressure to \u201ccomplete the mission\u201d are often involved. There are  an average of 7 human mistakes that culminate in disaster, and the stresses caused by these factors are believed by experts to play a major role in the accident chain of events. The course will also review accident causation models and employ case studies from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Aviation Accident Reports and those from international agencies.

Diamonds thesis is that history \u201cfollowed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.\u201d (p. 25)  Thus, human societies on different continents developed food production, writing, animal domestication, immunity to certain infectious diseases, and various technologies at different times (if they developed them at all), largely as a consequence of geography and the distribution of plants and animals (biogeography).  This course investigates Diamonds argument, compares it to alternative explanations for differences in the development of societies, and allows independent student research that will test Diamonds hypotheses.

Through applications to analysis of functions, optimizations and problems in sciences, a student can appreciate the importance of the derivative.  The concept of a definite integral as a limit of approximating sums emerges naturally in the context of problems of areas.  Hidden links between the two concepts are formulated in the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus, which also provide a convenient shortcut for computing definite integrals.

The Basic Research Seminar Series is a weekly meeting that includes the presentation and discussion of scientific data from individual members of GBGs basic research groups. These seminars will serve two functions: the critical analysis and proper planning of experiments and the opportunity to become familiarized with the various research projects and multiple scientific disciplines offered within GBG. This exposure will aid the students in their selection of laboratory rotations during the current semester. Held on a monthly basis, the Distinguished Lecturer Seminar Series provides students the unique opportunity to learn about various scientific disciplines from invited speakers who are experts in their fields. Both seminar series are held on the GBG campus. Within this course, students are expected to participate in the scientific discussion, are invited to ask questions of the presenters, and are required to submit written summaries, supplemented with information and references from relevant published articles, for each presentation.
