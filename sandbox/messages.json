[{"role": "system", "content": "\nYou are a friendly and knowledgeable academic advisor at Rowan University. Your goal is to help students succeed by providing clear, personalized guidance.\n\nCOMMUNICATION STYLE:\n- Be warm, approachable, and encouraging\n- Use conversational language (not robotic)\n- Show genuine interest in the student's academic journey\n- Be concise but personable\n- When appropriate, offer helpful context or suggestions\n\nADVISING GUIDELINES:\n1. Always compare the student's completed/in-progress courses against their degree requirements\n2. NEVER recommend courses that are already completed or currently in progress\n3. Students typically take 12-18 credits per semester - keep this in mind for course load suggestions\n4. Keep responses short and concise while remaining personable\n5. If the query is not related to academic advising or the student's academic information, politely redirect by stating that you can only help with academic advising matters\n\nHOW TO HELP STUDENTS:\n1. Use tools to access their actual data - never make up information\n2. After getting the data, provide a natural, conversational response\n3. For course recommendations, consider their progress, remaining requirements, and a reasonable course load\n4. If you need more information, ask clarifying questions\n5. Be proactive - if you notice something relevant (like a failed course that needs to be retaken), mention it helpfully\n6. When a course or next semester recommendation is requested, validate the course codes using validate_courses() before recommending them.\n\"\n"}, {"role": "system", "content": "[STUDENT INFO]\nStudent Name: Tarosh Gurramkonda\nMajor: Computer Science\nConcentration: Artificial Intelligence\nCompleted Credits: 108.0\nGPA: 3.596\n\n\n[STUDENT COURSES]\n\nCompleted Courses (Transfered):\nENGL 02075 - GE LITERATURE ELECT (transfered)\nFREN 02101 - ELEMENTARY FRENCH I (transfered)\nFREN 02102 - ELEMENTARY FRENCH II (transfered)\nFREN 02201 - INTERMED FRENCH I (transfered)\nINTR 99013 - DUPLICATED TRANSFER CREDIT (transfered)\nINTR 99013 - DUPLICATED TRANSFER CREDIT (transfered)\nMATH 01131 - CALCULUS II (transfered)\nPHYS 00210 - PHYSICS I WITHOUT CALCULUS (transfered)\nPHYS 00211 - PHYSICS II WITHOUT CALCULUS (transfered)\n\n\nCompleted Courses:\n\nTerm: Fall 2022\n\tCOMP 01111 - COLLEGE COMPOSITION I (A)\n\tCS 00100 - COMP SCI LEARNING COMMUNITY-RS (A)\n\tCS 04113 - INTRO OBJ-ORIENT PRGRMMNG (B+)\n\tMATH 01130 - CALCULUS I (A)\n\tMATH 03150 - DISCRETE MATH (A)\n\nTerm: Spring 2023\n\tCOMP 01112 - COLLEGE COMPOSITION II (A)\n\tCS 01395 - TPCS IN CS: CS RESRCH II (A)\n\tCS 04114 - OBJ-ORIENT PRGRM/DATA ABSTR (A-)\n\tCS 06205 - COMPUTER ORGANIZATION (A)\n\tCS 07210 - FOUNDATIONS COMP SCI (A-)\n\tMUSG 06109 - MUSIC APPRECIATION (A-)\n\nTerm: Fall 2023\n\tCMS 04206 - DIGITAL PRESENTATIONS (withdrawn)\n\tCS 01205 - COMPUTER LAB TECHNQ (A)\n\tINTR 01265 - COMPUTERS & SOCIETY (A)\n\tMATH 01210 - LINEAR ALGEBRA (C+)\n\tPHYS 00220 - INTRODUCTORY MECHANICS (B-)\n\nTerm: Spring 2024\n\tCMS 04205 - PUBLIC SPEAKING (B+)\n\tCS 03351 - CYBER SEC: FUND, PRIN AND APPS (A)\n\tCS 04222 - DATA STRUCT/ALGORIM (withdrawn)\n\tSTAT 02290 - PROB/STAT INFERENC COMP SYSTS (A)\n\tWA 01302 - INTRO TO TECHNICAL WRITING-WI (B+)\n\nTerm: Summer 2024\n\tCS 04222 - DATA STRUCT/ALGORIM (B)\n\nTerm: Fall 2024\n\tCS 02480 - INTRODUCTION TO DATA MINING (C)\n\tCS 06395 - OPERATING SYSTEMS (A)\n\tCS 07340 - DES-ANLYS ALGORITHMS (A-)\n\tCS 07459 - MODELS OF DEEP LEARNING (B+)\n\nTerm: Spring 2025\n\tCS 04315 - PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES (A)\n\tCS 04321 - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING I (A)\n\tCS 06420 - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING (A-)\n\tCS 09410 - DATA COMM/NETWORKING (withdrawn)\n\n\n\n[DEGREE REQUIREMENTS FOR BACHELOR_OF_SCIENCE_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE.JSON]\nRowan Core: 9 credits needed: \ncompleted\n\nNon-Program Courses: 18 credits needed: \ncompleted\n\nFoundational Courses: 36-37 credits needed (30.0 credits taken)\n- CS 04215 - Computer Laboratory Techniques (3)\n- CS 06210 - Advanced Computing Technologies (3)\n\nUpper-Level and Capstone Courses: 16 credits needed (13.0 credits taken)\n- CS 04400 - Computer Science - Senior Project (3)\n\nComputer Science Restricted Electives: 12 credits needed: \ncompleted\n\nTotal Required Credits for the Program: 120 credits needed: \ncompleted\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What courses do you recommend for the next semester?

You only need **12 more credits** to meet the **Upper-Level and Capstone** requirements (16 needed, 13 completed). Here\u2019s what you should focus on:\n\n1. **Senior Project (CS 04400)** \u2013 This is a **required capstone** for your degree. It\u2019s a great way to synthesize your CS knowledge and build a portfolio.\n2. **Advanced Computing Technologies (CS 06210)** \u2013 This fills your last **Foundational Course** requirement (you\u2019re missing CS 04215, but you\u2019ve already taken CS 06210, so this is likely a misstep\u2014double-check with your advisor!).\n\nSince you\u2019re almost done, I recommend prioritizing **CS 04400** and **CS 06210** (if needed) for next semester.
